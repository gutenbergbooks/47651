<h2><a name="WORDSWORTHS_POETICAL_WORKS" id="WORDSWORTHS_POETICAL_WORKS"></a>WORDSWORTH'S POETICAL WORKS<br />

<a name="EIGHTEEN_FOURTEEN" id="EIGHTEEN_FOURTEEN">1814</a></h2>

<p><em>The Excursion</em>&mdash;to which the fifth volume of this edition is
devoted&mdash;has been assigned to the year 1814; since it was finished,
and first published, in that year,&mdash;although commenced in 1795.
During the earlier stages of its composition, this poem was known, in
the Wordsworth household, as "The Pedlar"; and Dorothy Wordsworth tells
us in one of her letters to the Beaumonts, preserved amongst the
Coleorton MSS., that "The Pedlar" was finished at Christmas 1804. See
also the <cite>Memoirs of Wordsworth</cite>, by his nephew (vol. i. p. 304, etc.),
and Dorothy's Grasmere Journal, <em>passim</em>. But <cite>The Excursion</cite>, as we
have it now, was finished for press in 1814. The poems more immediately
belonging to that year are <cite>Laodamia</cite>, the <cite>Memorials of a Tour in
Scotland</cite>, <cite>Dion</cite>, and two Sonnets.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h3>LAODAMIA</h3>

<p class="center">Composed 1814.&mdash;Published 1815.</p>

<blockquote><p>[Written at Rydal Mount. The incident of the trees growing and withering
put the subject into my thoughts, and I wrote with the hope of giving it
a loftier tone than, so far as I know, has been given to it by any of
the Ancients who have treated of it. It cost me more trouble than almost
anything of equal length I have ever written.&mdash;I.F.]</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1815 and 1820 this poem was one of those "founded on the Affections";
afterwards it was classed among the "Poems of the
Imagination."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>After meeting the Wordsworths at Charles Lamb's, on the 9th May 1815,
Henry Crabb Robinson wrote in his <cite>Diary</cite>: "It is the mere power which
he is conscious of exerting in which he delights, not the production of
a work in which men rejoice on account of the sympathies and
sensibilities it excites in them. Hence, he does not much esteem his
<cite>Laodamia</cite>, as it belongs to the inferior class of poems founded on the
affections." (See <cite>Diary, Reminiscences, and Correspondence</cite>, vol.
i. p. 482.)</p>

<p>Wordsworth wrote thus to Walter Savage Landor, from Rydal Mount, on the
21st of January 1824:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"You have condescended to minute criticism upon the <cite>Laodamia</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_D_16" id="FNanchor_D_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_16" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> I
concur with you in the first stanza, and had several times attempted
to alter it upon your grounds. I cannot, however, accede to your
objection to the 'second birth,' merely because the expression has
been degraded by Conventiclers.<a name="FNanchor_E_17" id="FNanchor_E_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_17" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> I certainly meant nothing more by
it than the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">eadem cura</i>, and the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">largior æther</i>, etc., of Virgil's
Sixth <cite>Æneid</cite>. All religions owe their origin or acceptation to the
wish of the human heart to supply in another state of existence the
deficiencies of this, and to carry still nearer to perfection what
we admire in our present condition, so that there must be many modes
of expression arising out of this coincidence, or rather identity of
feeling common to all Mythologies; and under this observation I
should shelter the phrase from your censure&mdash;but I may be wrong in
the particular case, though certainly not in the general principle.
This leads to a remark in your last&mdash;'that you are disgusted with
all books that treat of religion.' I am afraid it is a bad sign in
me, that I have little relish for any other. Even in poetry it is
the imaginative only, viz., that which is conversant with or turns
upon Infinity, that powerfully affects me. Perhaps I ought to
explain: I mean to say that except in those passages, where things
are lost in each other, and limits vanish, and aspirations are
raised, I read with something too like indifference; but all great
Poets are in this view powerful Religionists."</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1815 Charles Lamb wrote to Wordsworth, "<cite>Laodamia</cite> is a very original
poem; I mean original with reference to your own manner. You have
nothing like it. I should have seen it in a strange place, and greatly
admired it, but not suspected its <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>derivation." (<cite>The Letters of Charles
Lamb</cite>, edited by Alfred Ainger, vol. i. p. 284.)</p>

<p>Mr. Hazlitt wrote of <cite>Laodamia</cite>: "It breathes the pure spirit of the
finest fragments of antiquity&mdash;the sweetness, the gravity, the strength,
the beauty, and the languor of Death. Its glossy brilliancy arises from
the perfection of the finishing, like that of careful sculpture, not
from gaudy colouring&mdash;the texture of the thoughts has the smoothness and
solidity of marble. It is a poem that might be read aloud in Elysium,
and the spirits of departed heroes and sages would gather round to
listen to it."</p>

<p>I am indebted to the Headmaster of Fettes College, Edinburgh, the Rev.
W. A. Heard, for the following illustrative notes on <cite>Laodamia</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"This poem illustrates more completely than any other the sympathy of
the poet with the spirit of antiquity in its purest and most exalted
forms. The idea that underlies the poem is the same conception of
'pietas' which Virgil has embodied in the <cite>Æneid</cite>, and with which he has
associated, especially in the sixth book, which Wordsworth in many
passages recalls, great ethical and religious conceptions, derived in
the main from the philosophy of Plato. 'Pietas' embraces all the duties
of life that are based upon the affections&mdash;love of home and
parents and children, love of the Gods of our Fathers, and a reverence
for that great order of things in which man finds himself a part. The
pious man believes in a destiny, or order transcending his own will: to
exalt any passion, however innocent, above this, is a rebellion; to
intensify any passion, so as to disturb the appropriate calm of
resignation, is to act irreverently against the gods. Lesser duties must
give way to greater: love of wife must give way to love of country, and
the sorrow of bereavement must not obscure the larger issues of life.
Thus, not only did Laodamia's yearning for the restoration of her
husband to life show a failure to recognise the fixity of eternal laws,
but her death was 'ὑπὲρ μόρον' and in reason's spite; it was,
after all, self-will, and could not win the favour of heaven.</p>

<p>Blending with this notion of 'pietas,' we find the Platonic repudiation
of sensuous and material life. This life is only a discipline under
imperfect conditions, and to be set free from the passion and
fretfulness of existence is the choice and longing of the wise.</p>

<p>The poem is thus notable, not so much for the assimilation of
details, as for natural affinity to the spirituality of antiquity,
of which Virgil is the purest exponent. Virgil's seriousness, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
tenderness, his conception of the inevitable, and yet moral, order
of the world, his desire for purification, his sadness, and yet
complete freedom from unmanliness, his love of nature and belief in
the sympathy of nature with man&mdash;all these are points of contact
between the ancient and modern poet.</p></blockquote>

<p>To his nephew, John Wordsworth, the poet wrote in 1831, explaining the
alterations he had made in the last stanza of <cite>Laodamia</cite>: "As at first
written, the heroine was dismissed to happiness in Elysium. To what
purpose then the mission of Protesilaus? He exhorts her to moderate her
passions; the exhortation is fruitless, and no punishment follows. So it
stood: at present she is placed among unhappy ghosts for disregard of
the exhortation. Virgil also places her there, but compare the two
passages, and give me <em>your</em> opinion." (<cite>William Wordsworth</cite>, by

<h3>MEMORIALS OF A TOUR IN SCOTLAND</h3>

<p class="center">1814</p>

<p>On the 18th July 1814, Wordsworth left Rydal, on a second visit to
Scotland, accompanied by his wife, and her sister, Sarah
Hutchinson.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<blockquote><p>[In this tour, my wife and her sister Sara were my companions. The
account of the "Brownie's Cell" and the Brownies was given me by a man
we met with on the banks of Loch Lomond, a little above Tarbert, and in
front of a huge mass of rock, by the side of which, we were told,
preachings were often held in the open air. The place is quite a
solitude, and the surrounding scenery very striking. How much is it to
be regretted that, instead of writing such Poems as the <cite>Holy Fair</cite> and
others, in which the religious observances of his country are treated
with so much levity and too often with indecency, Burns had not employed
his genius in describing religion under the serious and affecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
aspects it must so frequently take.<a name="FNanchor_F_31" id="FNanchor_F_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_31" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>&mdash;I.F.]</p></blockquote>

<p>The text of this poem was unaltered in the successive editions with a
single exception, occurring in the first line. It was suggested by, and
was a reminiscence of the tour in Scotland of 1814; but in 1803
Wordsworth visited the same spot alluded to in the Fenwick note,
accompanied by his sister, who thus describes it: "The most remarkable
object we saw was a huge single stone, I believe three or four times the
size of Bowder Stone. The top of it, which on one side was sloping like
the roof of a house, was covered with heather.... The ferryman told us
that a preaching was held there once in three months by a certain
minister&mdash;I think of Arrochar&mdash;who engages, as a part of his office, to
perform the service. The interesting feelings we had connected with the
Highland Sabbath and Highland worship returned here with double force.
The rock, though on one side a high perpendicular wall, in no place
overhung so as to form a shelter, in no place could it be more than a
screen from the elements. Why then had it been selected for such a
purpose? Was it merely from being a central situation and a conspicuous
object? Or did there belong to it some inheritance of superstition from
old times? It is impossible to look at the stone without asking, How
came it hither? Had then that obscurity and unaccountableness, that
mystery of power which is about it, any influence over the first persons
who resorted hither for worship? Or have they now on those who continue
to frequent it? The lake is in front of the perpendicular wall, and
behind, at some distance, and totally detached from it, is the
continuation of the ridge of mountain which forms the Vale of Loch
Lomond&mdash;a magnificent temple, of which this spot is a noble Sanctum
Sanctorum." (<cite>Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland, A.D. 1803</cite>, pp.
225-6.) The late Rev. William Macintosh of Buchanan supplied me with the
following information in reference to the Brownie's Cell and the Pulpit
Rock:&mdash;"I have little doubt that the Brownie's Cell is the name given by
Wordsworth to a small vault, itself a ruin among the ruins of an old
stronghold of the Macfarlanes in Eilan Vhow, an islet about three miles
from the head of the Loch. The name of the islet is spelt in different
ways; sometimes as I <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>have given it, sometimes Eilan Vow, or Eilan-a Vhu;
no one whom I consulted could tell me the right spelling. In the early
part of this century, the vault was the headquarters of a pedlar of the
name of Macfarlane. He may have been the Hermit; and there is a story
of his having been frightened by the sudden apparition of a negro,
(probably the first he had ever seen), who had been ordered by his
master&mdash;an English officer&mdash;to swim across for that purpose: and it is
said that he never again visited the cell.</p>

<p>The Pulpit Rock, also called by a Gaelic name meaning the Bull Stone, is
a very large boulder, or detached rock, which is likely to 'stand' as
long as Ben Lomond. In the face of it, there is an artificial doorway
and recess, which at one time the Parish Minister used to occupy as a
Pulpit for occasional services. The audience sat on turf seats ranged
round the foot of the Rock. The pulpit was reached by a few steps cut
out, I suppose, in the Rock: but it has never been used for the last
twenty years. The 'occasional' services are now held in a neighbouring
schoolroom."</p>

<p>Mr. Malcolm M'Farlane, a very intelligent sheep farmer in Buchanan
parish, supplies the following additional information about the Cell and
the Rock:&mdash;"The 'Pulpit Rock' is a cell in the face of a large stone,
blasted out with gunpowder. The proper appellation is, in Gaelic,
'Clach-nan-Tairbh,' literally translated the 'Stone of the Bulls.' It
was formed about 50 or 60 years ago, the then minister of Arrochar, Mr.
Proudfoot, had promised to preach in that part of his parish, on several
occasions during the year, provided they would get up a place for his
reception.... It was capable of containing three or four persons inside,
was done up with wood work, an outer and inner door, with stone steps
leading to the recess. They were not formed out of the rock, but other
stones got up for the purpose, and turf seats laid out for the hearers,
who were all exposed to the weather, except so far as they might be
sheltered by the rock. The service has been discontinued at the rock for
about twenty-five years, and is now held at a schoolhouse. The doors are
gone, and no portion of the wood work remains. The cell is now used only
as a nightly retreat for mendicants, tinkers," etc. Wordsworth's
reference, in the Fenwick note, to Burns's <cite>Holy Fair</cite> induces me
to quote what follows in Mr. M'Farlane's letter:&mdash;"Open air preaching
was then very general in the Highlands: the people came long distances,
travelled over hills, even in inclement weather, to attend them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
An individual who kept a small inn, on the loch side opposite Inversnaid,
used regularly to attend the meetings with a supply of whisky; but he
remained behind the 'rock' till the services were over, when the people
partook of his refreshments. Also, on the north side of Loch Katrine,
the minister of Callander used to conduct services in the open air, on
several occasions during the year, in that distant part of his parish.
An old man, who lived near the Trossachs, whom I remember very well,
regularly attended with a supply of whisky. Dr. Robertson, who was then
minister, after concluding the sermon, had gone to an adjoining farm
house. The people had indulged too freely, so that a fight commenced
(the same thing had happened on several occasions before). The Doctor
had to leave his dinner in order to get them separated, and to put an
end to the battle, but he never allowed any more whisky to be brought to
the place afterwards.... These may be irrelevant matters, but they might
illustrate a chapter in Lecky's <cite>History of Morals</cite>, as there is more
decorum now observed. Since writing the above, I have thought that if
the pulpit-rock is mentioned in Miss Wordsworth's Tour, Mr. M'Nicol, my
informant, must have made a mistake in stating the time it was made, as
about 50 or 60 years ago; but it cannot have been much more than 80
years, as it is not very long since some of the people who were engaged
in the operation died.</p>

<p>"Regarding the island near the head of Loch Lomond which is termed
'Eilan (Island) Vow' in Black's <cite>Guide</cite>, and somewhat differently
spelt in others, in the original Gaelic it is 'Eilan a Bh&#363;th.'
B&#363;th is a Gaelic name for a shop, so that it is 'the island of the
shop.' The English Vow has no connection whatever with the Gaelic, and
is perfectly unintelligible. It is part of undoubted traditional history
that the chiefs of the Clan M'Farlane, who owned a considerable portion
of the adjoining lands, had their residence here. In these turbulent
times islands were considered more secure, as surrounded with water.
They kept a 'shop' in the island, from which they supplied the little
wants of the surrounding population, so that it is perfectly clear how
the Island derived its name. A good portion of the stronghold is still
in good preservation. A part of the wall is about thirty feet high. It
is a very old building. Mr. M'Nicol states that he had learned from his
grandfather, by the tradition in the family, that it was erected between
the eleventh and the twelfth century. The late Sir James Colquhoun,
about twelve years ago, laid out some money for keeping the walls in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
preservation. At the bottom of the Fort, and below the level of the
floor, is the 'Brownie's Cell,' several steps leading down to it, and it
is partly underground. It is about twelve feet wide, and sixteen feet
long, with an arched roof, the mason work being still in good repair.
There is some glimmering light emitted by two small apertures formed in
the walls at each end. I have been unable to obtain any specific
information what purpose it served in connection with the other
building. Some said that it must have been a prison, and others a store
for the shop. It might have been a prison at first, and afterwards, in
more pacific times, used as a store.</p>

<p>"About the beginning of this century, the Island was occupied by a very
eccentric individual, who led the life of a hermit, and took up his
abode in this recess. He made frequent excursions out of it, but always
returned to his Island-home before the end of the week. It was not then
planted with wood, so that he cultivated a part of the ground, raised
some crops, kept some poultry. He trained the poultry to fly on the
approach of any stranger, so that they could not be got hold of, or
taken away in his absence from the Island. He also kept a curious diary,
in which local events, his own doings and opinions, were recorded in
great detail, expressed in very quaint language. It was by the age of
the moon, and not by the days of the month, that events were entered in
the diary. He also cultivated astrology, and believed in the evil
influence of some of the stars. He had a firm belief in ghosts; but he
never was so frightened as when the Black Man (that is the negro), who
he thought belonged to the invisible world, swam to the island. Of that
adventure I have not been able to obtain a more detailed account, but
his landing there very nearly put him out of his wits. The grandfather
of the present Duke of Montrose had, on one occasion, visited the
Island; and, when landing, the Hermit addressed him, 'James Graham, the
Duke of Montrose, you are welcome to come and see my Island.'..."</p>

<p>There is no evidence that the ruin was once "a consecrated Pile," as
stated in the poem. Wordsworth had evidently heard of the Hermit's
writings, as mentioned by Mr. M'Farlane. See stanza vi., "guiding a pen
unwearied."</p>

<p>In the <cite>Diary, Reminiscences, and Correspondence</cite> of Henry Crabb
Robinson, there is an entry, dated January 2, 1820:&mdash;"Went to Lamb's,
where I found Mr. and Mrs. Wordsworth.... Not much was said about his
(W.'s) new volume of Poems. He himself spoke of <cite>The Brownie's Cell</cite>
as his favourite" <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>(vol. ii. p. 162). In the following year Mr. Crabb
Robinson himself visited Scotland, and wrote thus on the 16th
September:&mdash;"Being on the western side of Loch Lomond, opposite the Mill
at Inversnaid, some women kindled a fire, the smoke of which was to be a
signal for a ferryboat. No ferryman came; and a feeble old man offering
himself as a boatman, I intrusted myself to him. I asked the women who
he was. They said, 'That's old Andrew.' According to their account he
lived a hermit's life in a lone island on the lake; the poor peasantry
giving him meal, and what he wanted, and he picking up pence. On my
asking him whether he would take me across the lake, he said, 'I wull,
if you'll gi'e me saxpence.' So I consented. But before I was half over
I repented of my rashness, for I feared the oars would fall out of his
hands. A breath of wind would have rendered half the voyage too much for
him. There was some cunning mixed up with the fellow's seeming
imbecility, for when his strength was failing he rested, and entered
into talk, manifestly to amuse me. He said he could see things before
they happened. He saw the Radicals before they came, etc. He had picked
up a few words of Spanish and German, which he uttered ridiculously, and
laughed. But when I put troublesome questions he affected not to
understand me; and was quite astonished, as well as delighted, when I
gave him two sixpences instead of the one he had bargained for. The
simple-minded women, who affected to look down on him, seemed, however,
to stand in awe of him, and no wonder. On my telling Wordsworth this
history, he exclaimed, 'That's my "Brownie!"' His <cite>Brownie's Cell</cite> is by
no means one of my favourite poems. My sight of old Andrew showed me the
stuff out of which a poetical mind can weave such a web" (vol. ii. pp.
212, 213).</p>

and other Poems," of the Tour made in Scotland in the autumn of
1831.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

EFFUSION,</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">In the Pleasure-Ground on the Banks of the Bran, near Dunkeld</span></p>

<p class="center">Composed 1814.&mdash;Published 1827</p>

<blockquote><p>[I am not aware that this condemnatory effusion was ever seen by the
owner of the place. He might be disposed to pay little attention to it;
but were it to prove otherwise I should be glad, for the whole
exhibition is distressingly puerile.&mdash;I.F.]</p></blockquote>

<p>"The waterfall, by a loud roaring, warned us when we must expect it. We
were first, however, conducted into a small apartment, where the
Gardener desired us to look at a picture of Ossian, which, while he was
telling the history of the young <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>Artist who executed the work,
disappeared, parting in the middle&mdash;flying asunder as by the touch of
magic&mdash;and lo! we are at the entrance of a splendid apartment, which was
almost dizzy and alive with waterfalls, that tumbled in all directions;
the great cascade, opposite the window, which faced us, being reflected
in innumerable mirrors upon the ceiling and against the
walls."&mdash;<cite>Extract from the Journal of my Fellow-Traveller.</cite><a name="FNanchor_L_43" id="FNanchor_L_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_43" class="fnanchor">[L]</a></p>

<h3>"FROM THE DARK CHAMBERS OF DEJECTION FREED"</h3>

<p class="center">Composed 1814.&mdash;Published 1815</p>

<blockquote><p>[Composed in Edinburgh, during my Scotch tour with Mrs. Wordsworth and
my sister, Miss Hutchinson, in the year 1814. Poor Gillies never rose
above that course of extravagance in which he was at that time living,
and which soon reduced him to poverty and all its degrading shifts,
mendicity being far from the worst. I grieve whenever I think of him,
for he was far from being without genius, and had a generous heart, not
always to be found in men given up to profusion. He was nephew of Lord
Gillies, the Scotch judge, and also of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>historian of Greece.
He was cousin to Miss Margaret Gillies, who painted so many portraits
with success in our house.&mdash;I.F.]</p></blockquote>

<p>Classed among the "Miscellaneous Sonnets." In 1815 the sonnet was headed
<em>To</em> &mdash;&mdash;.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

  <div class="i0">A cheerful life is what the Muses love,</div>
  <div class="i0">A soaring spirit is their prime delight.</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>I am indebted to Miss Margaret Gillies&mdash;the artist referred to in the
Fenwick note&mdash;for information in reference to her cousin, the subject of
this sonnet. Robert Pearce Gillies was a man of unquestionable talent,
but eccentric and extravagant. He inherited a considerable fortune, some
&pound;1500 a year, from his father, which he lost. He was editor of the
<cite>Foreign Quarterly Review</cite>, was very intimate with De Quincey, and knew
Sir Walter Scott, Wordsworth, and Quillinan well. He translated several
German poems and novels, of which Scott thought highly. He was the
author of <cite>Memoirs of a Literary Veteran</cite> (1851), in which (vol. ii. pp.
137-173) there is a sketch of Wordsworth, and several letters from him.
He was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>also an accomplished musician, playing the violin admirably. He
lived near Hawthornden.</p>

<p>The expression "faded" or "fading grove," which Wordsworth applies to
Roslin, may refer merely to the season of the year, viz. September.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>A sonnet written by Gillies, and addressed to Wordsworth, may be quoted
in this note. It was transcribed by Mrs. Wordsworth into a copy of the
4to edition of <cite>The Excursion</cite> (1814), which was presented by the Poet
to his grandson.</p>

YARROW VISITED</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">September, 1814</span></p>

<p class="center">Composed 1814.&mdash;Published 1815</p>

<blockquote><p>[As mentioned in my verses on the death of the Ettrick Shepherd, my
first visit to Yarrow was in his company. We had lodged the night before
at Traquair, where Hogg had joined us, and also Dr. Anderson, the Editor
of the <cite>British Poets</cite>, who was on a visit at the Manse. Dr. A. walked with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
us till we came in view of the Vale of Yarrow, and, being advanced
in life, he then turned back. The old man was passionately fond of
poetry, though with not much of a discriminating judgment, as the
Volumes he edited sufficiently shew. But I was much pleased to meet with
him, and to acknowledge my obligation to his collection, which had been
my brother John's companion in more than one voyage to India, and which
he gave me before his departure from Grasmere, never to return. Through
these Volumes I became first familiar with Chaucer, and so little money
had I then to spare for books, that, in all probability, but for this
same work, I should have known little of Drayton, Daniel, and other
distinguished poets of the Elizabethan age, and their immediate
successors, till a much later period of my life. I am glad to record
this, not from any importance of its own, but, as a tribute of gratitude
to this simple-hearted old man, whom I never again had the pleasure of
meeting. I seldom read or think of this poem without regretting that my
dear Sister was not of the party, as she would have had so much delight
in recalling the time, when, travelling together in Scotland, we
declined going in search of this celebrated stream, not altogether, I
will frankly confess, for the reasons assigned in the poem on the
occasion.&mdash;I.F.]</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1815 and 1820 this was one of the "Poems of the Imagination." In 1827
it became one of the "Memorials of a Tour in Scotland" of 1814.</p>

<p>The MS. readings to this poem are taken from a copy in a letter by
Dorothy Wordsworth to Mrs. Clarkson, dated November 11, 1814.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>In 1815 few poems were written, with the exception of the
<cite>Dedication to The White Doe of Rylstone</cite>, one or two sonnets,
and <cite>Artegal and Elidure</cite>. If we were to trust entirely to the
Fenwick note to <cite>Laodamia</cite>, <cite>Artegal and Elidure</cite> would require
to be transferred, along with it and <cite>Dion</cite>, to 1814. When
Wordsworth, in 1845, separated the <cite>Ode</cite>, beginning</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Imagination&mdash;ne'er before content</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>from the <cite>Ode, the morning of the Day appointed for a General
Thanksgiving, January 18, 1816</cite>, he gave to the former the
date 1815; and it is possible that it was composed towards the
close of that year. But it was originally published in 1816 as
part of the <cite>Thanksgiving Ode</cite>; and, although (in conformity
with the plan of adopting the Author's latest view of his own
text) it is printed by itself,&mdash;as finally approved by him,&mdash;it is
not placed in the year 1815, but in 1816. The chief reason
for this is, that it is kindred in theme, structure, and tendency
with the other Odes belonging to that year; and it seems better&mdash;when
there is a doubt as to the date&mdash;to bring together those
poems that are kindred in character. It does not follow, however,
that part of the <cite>Thanksgiving Ode</cite> itself may not have
been written in 1815. Wordsworth, writing to Southey in
1816, said:&mdash;"It is a poem composed, <em>or supposed to be composed</em>,
on the morning of the thanksgiving." Those belonging to the
year 1815 are, therefore, few in number.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>Although this <cite>Dedication</cite> was only written in April 1815, it

poem itself&mdash;in its chronological place (1807) (see vol. iv. p. 100);
but as I have seen a MS. copy of this <cite>Dedication</cite>, which differs
considerably from the final text, and was probably the first draft
of the poem, it may be printed here. In the MS. I refer to, it
is called <cite>Epistle Dedicatory</cite>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

their wit will know how to use them judiciously."&mdash;I.F.]</p></blockquote>

legendary founder of the British race&mdash;according to the story in Geoffrey of
Monmouth's Chronicle&mdash;after a somewhat chequered career in Greece, consulted
Diana where he should go and settle. To whom Diana in a vision

<p>"Brutus guided now," says Milton (following Monmouth), "by Divine
conduct, speeds him towards the West."... After some adventures in the
Adriatic and in Gaul, "with an easy course, arriving at Totness, in
Devonshire, quickly perceives here to be the promised end of his
labours.</p>

<p>"The island, not yet <em>Britain</em> but <em>Albion</em>, was in a manner desert, and
inhospitable; kept only by a remnant of <em>Giants</em>; whose excessive Force
and Tyrannie had consumed the rest. Them Brutus destroies, and to his
people divides the Land, which with som reference to his own name, he
henceforth calls Britain." (Milton's <cite>History of England</cite>, book

Male Issue: governed laudably, and built <em>Caer-Leir</em>, now <em>Leicester</em>,
on the bank of <em>Sora</em>. But at last, failing through Age, he determines
to bestow his Daughters, and so among them to divide his Kingdom. Yet
first to try which of them loved him best, (a Trial that might have made
him, had he known as wisely how to try, as he seemed to know how much
the trying behooved him) <em>he resolves a simple resolution, to ask them
solemnly in order; and which of them should profess largest, her to
beleev</em>. <em>Gonorill</em> the Eldest, apprehending too well her Father's
weakness, makes answer invoking Heaven, <em>That she loved him above her
Soul</em>. <em>Therefore</em>, quoth the old man, overjoyed, <em>since thou so
honourst my declined Age, to thee and the Husband whom thou shalt
choose, I give the third part of my Realm</em>. So fair a speeding for a few
words soon uttered, was to <em>Regan</em> the second, ample instruction what to
say. She on the same demand spares no protesting, and the Gods must
witness that otherwise to express her thoughts she knew not, but that
<em>she loved him above all Creatures</em>; and so receavs an equal reward with
her Sister. But <em>Cordeilla</em>, the youngest, though hitherto best beloved,
and now before her Eyes the rich and present hire of a little easie
soothing, the danger also, and the loss likely to betide plain dealing,
yet moves not from the solid purpose of a sincere and vertuous answer.
<em>Father</em>, saith she, <em>my love towards you, is as my duty bids; what
should a Father seek, what can a Child promise more? they who pretend
beyond this, flatter</em>. When the old man, sorry to hear this, and wishing
her to recall those words, persisted asking, with a loiall sadness at
her Father's infirmity, but something on the sudden, harsh, and
glancing, rather at her Sisters, then speaking her own mind, <em>Two waies
only</em>, saith she, <em>I have to answer what you require mee; the former,
Your command is, I should recant; accept then this other which is left
me; look how much you have, so much is your value, and so much I love
you</em>. <em>Then hear thou</em>, quoth <em>Leir</em> now all in passion, <em>what thy
ingratitude hath gained thee; because thou hast not reverenced thy aged
father equall to thy Sisters, part in my Kingdom, or what else is mine
reck'n to have none</em>. And without delay gives in marriage his other
Daughters, <em>Gonorill</em> to <em>Maglannus</em> Duke of Albana, <em>Regan</em> to
<em>Henninus</em> Duke of <em>Cornwal</em>; with them in present half his Kingdom; the
rest to follow at his Death. In the mean while Fame was not sparing to
divulge the wisdom, and other Graces of <em>Cordeilla</em>, insomuch that
<em>Aganippus a great King in Gaul</em> (however he came by his Greek name)
seeks her to Wife, and nothing alter'd at the loss of her Dowry, receavs
her gladly in such manner as she was sent him. After this <em>King Leir</em>,
more and more drooping with years, became an easy prey to his Daughters
and thir Husbands; who now by dayly encroachment had seis'd the whole
Kingdom into thir hands: and the old King is put to sojorn with his
Eldest Daughter, attended only by three score Knights. But they in a
short while grudged at, as too numerous and disorderly for continuall
guests, are reduced to thirty. Not brooking that affront, the old King
betakes him to his second Daughter; but there also discord soon arising
between the Servants of differing Masters in one Family, five only are
suffer'd to attend him. Then back again he returns to the other; hoping
that she his Eldest could not but have more pity on his Gray Hairs: but
she now refuses to admitt him, unless he be content with one only of his
followers. At last the remembrance of his youngest <em>Cordeilla</em> comes to
his thoughts; and now acknowledging how true her words had bin, though
with little hope from whom he had so injur'd, be it but to pay her the
last recompence she can have from him, his confession of her wise
forewarning, that so perhaps his misery, the prooff and experiment of
her Wisdom, might somthing soft'n her, he takes his Journey into
<em>France</em>. Now might be seen a difference between the silent, or
downright spok'n affection of som Children to thir Parents, and the
talkative obsequiousness of others: while the hope of Inheritance
over-acts them, and on the Tongue's end enlarges thir duty. <em>Cordeilla</em>
out of meer love, without the suspicion of expected reward, at the
message only of her Father in distress, pours forth true filial tears.
And not enduring either that her own, or any other Eye should see him in
such forlorn condition as his Messenger declar'd, discreetly appoints
one of her trusted Servants, first to convay him privately toward som
good Sea Town, there to array him, bathe him, cherish him, furnish him
with such Attendance and State, as beseem'd his Dignity. That then, as
from his first Landing, he might send word of his Arrival to her Husband
<em>Aganippus</em>. Which don with all mature and requisite contrivance,
<em>Cordeilla</em> with the King her Husband, and all the Barony of his Realm,
who then first had news of his passing the Sea, goe out to meet him; and
after all honourable and joyfull entertainment, <em>Aganippus</em>, as to his
Wives Father, and his Royall Guest, surrenders him, during his abode
there, the power, and disposal of his whole Dominion; permitting his
Wife <em>Cordeilla</em> to go with an Army, and set her Father upon his Throne.
Wherein her piety so prospered, as that she vanquished her impious
Sisters with those Dukes, and <em>Leir</em> again, as saith the story, three
years obtained the Crown. To whom dying, <em>Cordeilla</em> with all regal
Solemnities gave Burial in the Town of <em>Leicester</em>. And then as right
Heir succeeding, and her Husband dead, rul'd the land five years in
peace." (Milton, <cite>History of England</cite>, book i.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<cite>Archigallo</cite>, and <cite>Elidure</cite>:&mdash;"<em>Gorbonian</em> the Eldest of his five Sons,
then whom a juster man liv'd not in his Age, was a great builder of
Temples, and gave to all what was thir due; to his
Gods devout Worship, to men of desert honour and preferment; to the
Commons encouragement in thir Labours, and Trades, defence and
protection from injuries and oppressions, so that the Land florish'd
above her Neighbours, Violence and Wrong seldom was heard of; his Death
was a general loss; he was buried in <em>Trinovant</em>.</p>

<p>"<em>Archigallo</em> the second Brother followed not his Example; but depress'd
the ancient Nobility, and by peeling the wealthier sort, stuff'd his
Treasury, and took the right way to be depos'd.</p>

<p>"<em>Elidure</em> the next Brother, surnamed the Pious, was set up in his
place; a mind so noble, and so moderat, as almost is incredible to
have bin ever found. For having held the Scepter five years, hunting one
day in the Forest of <em>Calater</em>, he chanc'd to meet his deposed Brother,
wandering in mean condition; who had bin long in vain beyond the Seas,
importuning Foren aides to his Restorement: and was now in a poor Habit,
with only ten followers, privatly return'd to find subsistence among his
secret friends. At the unexpected sight of him, <em>Elidure</em> himself also
then but thinly accompanied, runs to him with open Arms; and after many
dear and sincere welcomings, convaies him to the Citty <em>Alclud</em>; there
hides him in his own Bed-Chamber. Afterwards faining himself sick,
summons all his Peers as about greatest affairs; where admitting them
one by one, as if his weakness endur'd not the disturbance of more at
once, causes them, willing or unwilling, once more to swear Allegiance
to <em>Archigallo</em>. Whom after reconciliation made on all sides, he leads
to <em>York</em>: and from his own Head, places the Crown on the Head of his
Brother, who thenceforth, Vice itself dissolving in him, and forgetting
her firmest hold with the admiration of a deed so Heroic, became a true
converted man: rul'd worthily 10 years; dy'd and was Buried in
<em>Caer-Leir</em>. Thus was a Brother saved by a Brother, to whom love of
a Crown, the thing that so often dazles, and vitiates mortal man, for
which thousands of neerest blood have destroy'd each other, was in
respect of Brotherly dearness, a contemptible thing." (Milton, <cite>History

<h3>TO B. R. HAYDON</h3>

<p class="center">Composed December 1815.&mdash;Published March 31, 1816.</p>

<p class="center">One of the "Miscellaneous Sonnets." The title "Esq." was appended to the
name in the editions of 1820 to 1832.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

  <div class="i0">Faith in the whispers of the lonely Muse,</div>
  <div class="i0">While the whole world seems adverse to desert.</div>
  <div class="i0">And, oh! when Nature sinks, as oft she may</div>

  <div class="i0">Still to be strenuous for the bright reward,</div>

  <div class="i0">Brook no continuance of weak-mindedness&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Great is the glory, for the strife is hard!</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>This sonnet was first published in <cite>The Examiner</cite> (March 31, 1816). It
was composed in December 1815. On November 27, Haydon wrote to
Wordsworth: "I have benefited, and have been supported in the troubles
of life by your poetry. I will bear want, pain, misery, and blindness,
but I will never yield one step I have gained on the road I am
determined to travel over." (See his <cite>Correspondence and Table Talk</cite>,
vol. ii. pp. 19, 20.) To this Wordsworth replied in the following letter
which is explanatory of the above sonnet, and of the two sonnets that
follow it.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 6em;">"<span class="smcap">Rydal Mount</span>, near <span class="smcap">Ambleside</span>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><em>December 21st, 1815</em>.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 6em;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</span></p>

<p>"Now for the poems, which are sonnets: one composed the evening I
received your letter; the other the next day; and the third the day
following. I shall not transcribe them in the order in which they were
written, but inversely.</p>

<p>"The last you will find was occasioned, I might say inspired, by your
last letter, if there be any inspiration in it; the second records a
feeling excited in me by the object it describes in the month of October
last; and the first by a still earlier sensation, which the revolution
of the year impressed me with last autumn."</p>

<p>(Then follow the three sonnets transcribed in the following order&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"While not a leaf seems faded; while the fields."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"How clear, how keen, how marvellously bright."</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"High is our calling, Friend!&mdash;Creative Art.")</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span style="margin-left: 6em;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</span></p>

<p>"With high respect, I am, my dear sir, most faithfully yours.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">"<span class="smcap">William Wordsworth.</span>"</span></p>

<p>(See the <cite>Autobiography of B. R. Haydon</cite>, vol. i. chap. xvi. p. 325.)</p>

<p>Haydon replied to Wordsworth, December 29 (see his <cite>Correspondence</cite>,
vol. ii. pp. 20-23): "I must say that I have felt melancholy ever since
receiving your sonnets, as if I was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>elevated so exceedingly, with such
a drunken humming in my brain, that my nature took refuge in quiet
humbleness and gratitude to God."</p>

<p>It will be observed that in his letter of December 21, Wordsworth
mentions the order in which these three sonnets were composed in three
consecutive days. In his subsequent arrangement of the sonnets he
altered this order, assigning "While not a leaf seems faded" to
"September," and "How clear, how keen," to "November 1" (another
instance of the inaccuracy of his dates). The detailed statement in this
letter to Haydon must be trusted, however, in preference to the
"afterthought" of the editions of 1820 and 1827. It may not be
superfluous to note the dates of the first publication of this trilogy
of sonnets, all of which Wordsworth sent to <cite>The Examiner</cite>.</p>

night. The same cottage is alluded to in the <cite>Epistle to Sir George

<h3>"EVEN AS A DRAGON'S EYE THAT FEELS

  <div class="i0">Conversing, reading, laughing;&mdash;or they sing,</div>
  <div class="i0">While hearts and voices in the song unite.</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The light of the "Taper" referred to shone from Allan Bank; the "black
recess of mountains" described the heights of Silver Howe, and Easdale,
round to Helm Crag; the "lake below," which "reflected it not" (because
of the distance of Allan Bank from the side of the mere), was, of
course, Grasmere. Wordsworth is looking at this "lamp suddenly glaring
through sepulchral damp," however, from the eastern side of the lake,
perhaps from the neighbourhood of "The Wishing Gate." I am indebted to
the Rev. W. A. Harrison, Vicar of St. Anne's, Lambeth, for the following
note to this sonnet:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>'In the Sonnet No. xxiv., 'Poems of the Imagination,'
[<em>i.e.</em> 'Miscellaneous Sonnets'] these lines occur:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Even as a dragon's eye that feels the stress</div>
  <div class="i0">Of a bedimming sleep, or as a lamp</div>
  <div class="i0">Suddenly glaring through sepulchral damp,</div>
  <div class="i0">So burns yon Taper 'mid a black recess</div>
  <div class="i0">Of mountains, silent, dreary, motionless:</div>
  <div class="i7">etc. etc. etc.</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>"In line 3, all the later editions read 'Suddenly glaring.' But why
'suddenly'? There is nothing in the imagery of the poem which is at all
suggestive of suddenness or unexpectedness in the appearance of the
burning taper. The idea is alien from the spirit of the context. The
dragon is drowsy and overborne with sleep. The taper is 'dreary' and
'motionless.' Everything is suggestive of 'sluggish stillness,' not of
rapid, flashing movement.</p>

<p>"Yet I find the reading '<em>suddenly</em>' in the one vol. ed. of 1828, which
is said to be a reprint of the edition of 1827 in 5 vols.; in that of
1836-7; in that of 1840; and in all the later editions.</p>

<p>"In the edition of 1815, however, the reading given is one that is in
strict keeping with the rest of the imagery, namely&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">'<i>Sullenly</i> glaring.'</p>

<p>"Is it likely that 'sullenly' was deliberately altered by Wordsworth to
'suddenly,' or is 'suddenly' a misprint that has been perpetuated
through successive editions?</p>

<p>"The sonnet in question is not dated, but it was probably written after
1807 and before 1815.</p>

<p>"Now, in a well-known and often-quoted passage in Wordsworth's letter in
answer to Mathetes (<i>Friend</i>, vol. iii. 35, etc.), he speaks of the
'<i>sullen</i> light' which survives the extinguished flame of the candle
that the schoolboy has blown out. 'It continues,' he says, 'to shine
with an endurance which in its apparent weakness is a mystery; it
protracts its existence so long ... that the observer who had lain down
in his bed so easy-minded, becomes sad and melancholy,' etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>"In the sonnet the same ideas occur, only the 'melancholy' is here
predicated figuratively of the 'light' itself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><span style="margin-left: 12em;">the sky,</span></div>

 </div>
</div>

<p>"This paper in <cite>The Friend</cite> was written in 1810; and it is possible that
the sonnet was written at about the same time.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. A. Harrison.</span>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h3>"MARK THE CONCENTRED HAZELS THAT ENCLOSE"</h3>

<p class="center">Published 1815</p>

<blockquote><p>[Suggested in the wild hazel wood at the foot of Helm-crag, where the
stone still lies, with others of like form and character, though much of
the wood that veiled it from the glare of day has been felled. This
beautiful ground was lately purchased by our friend Mrs. Fletcher; the
ancient owners, most respected persons, being obliged to part with it in
consequence of the imprudence of a son. It is gratifying to mention
that, instead of murmuring and repining at this change of fortune, they
offered their services to Mrs. Fletcher, the husband as an outdoor
labourer, and the wife as a domestic servant. I have witnessed the pride
and pleasure with which the man worked at improvements of the ground
round the house. Indeed he expressed those feelings to me himself, and
the countenance and manner of his wife always denoted feelings of the
same character. I believe a similar disposition to contentment under
change of fortune is common among the class to which these good people
belong. Yet, in proof that to part with their patrimony is most painful
to them, I may refer to those stanzas entitled <cite>Repentance</cite>, no
inconsiderable part of which was taken verbatim from the language of the
speaker herself.&mdash;I. F.]</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="EIGHTEEN_SIXTEEN" id="EIGHTEEN_SIXTEEN"></a>1816</h2>


<p>Most of the poems belonging to 1816 were suggested by the stirring
political events of that year on the Continent of Europe. Four odes, and
a number of sonnets,&mdash;referring to the Fall of Napoleon, the French army
in Russia, the battle of Waterloo, etc.,&mdash;a translation of part of
Virgil's <cite>Æneid</cite>, and one or two smaller fragments, make up the series.
Wordsworth had not been so much inspired by the political events of his
time, since the years 1809 and 1810&mdash;when he wrote the Tyrolese Sonnets,
and others, "Dedicated to Liberty," etc.&mdash;but, both before and during
the year 1816, he spent some time in preparing his eldest son for the
University. He read the Latin poets with him; and very probably it was
this that led him to translate into English verse, the three first books
of the <cite>Æneid</cite>, which he did at this time. Some fragments of his
Translations will be found in the Appendix to vol. viii.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>


<hr class="chap" />
<h3>ODE<br />
<span class="smcap">The Morning of the Day appointed for a
General Thanksgiving. January 18, 1816</span></h3>

<p class="center">Composed 1816.&mdash;Published 1816.</p>

<blockquote><p>[The first stanza of this <cite>Ode</cite> was composed almost extempore, in front
of Rydal Mount, before church-time, and on such a morning and precisely
with such objects before my eyes as are here described. The view taken
of Napoleon's character and proceedings is little in accordance with
that taken by some historians and critical philosophers. I am glad and
proud of the difference, and trust that this series of poems, infinitely
below the subject as they are, will survive to counteract, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
unsophisticated minds, the pernicious and degrading tendency of those
views and doctrines that lead to the idolatry of power, as power, and,
in that false splendour, to lose sight of its real nature and
constitution as it often acts for the gratification of its possessor
without reference to a beneficial end&mdash;an infirmity that has
characterised men of all ages, classes, and employments, since Nimrod
became a mighty hunter before the Lord.&mdash;I. F.]</p></blockquote>

<p>"It is not to bespeak favour or indulgence, but to guard against
misapprehension, that the author presumes to state that the present
publication owes its existence to a patriotism, anxious to exert itself
in commemorating that course of action, by which Great Britain has, for
some time past, distinguished herself above all other countries.</p>

<p>"Wholly unworthy of touching upon so momentous a subject would that Poet
be, before whose eyes the present distresses under which this kingdom
labours, could interpose a veil sufficiently thick to hide, or even to
obscure, the splendour of this great moral triumph. If the author has
given way to exultation, unchecked by these distresses, it might be
sufficient to protect him from a charge of insensibility, should he
state his own belief that these sufferings will be transitory. On the
wisdom of a very large majority of the British nation, rested that
generosity which poured out the treasures of this country for the
deliverance of Europe: and in the same national wisdom, presiding in
time of peace over an energy not inferior to that which has been
displayed in war, <em>they</em> confide, who encourage a firm hope, that the
cup of our wealth will be gradually replenished. There will, doubtless,
be no few ready to indulge in regrets and repinings; and to feed a
morbid satisfaction, by aggravating these burthens in imagination, in
order that calamity so confidently prophesied, as it has not taken the
shape which their sagacity allotted to it, may appear as grievous as
possible under another. But the body of the nation will not quarrel with
the gain, because it might have been purchased at a less price: and
acknowledging in these sufferings, which they feel to have been in a
great degree unavoidable, a consecration of their noble efforts, they
will vigorously apply themselves to remedy the evil.</p>

<p>"Nor is it at the expense of rational patriotism, or in disregard of
sound philosophy, that the author hath given vent to feelings tending to
encourage a martial spirit in the bosoms of his countrymen, at a time
when there is a general outcry <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>against the prevalence of these
dispositions. The British army, both by its skill and valour in the
field, and by the discipline which has rendered it much less formidable
than the armies of other powers, to the inhabitants of the several
countries where its operations were carried on, has performed services
for humanity too important and too obvious to allow any one to
recommend, that the language of gratitude and admiration be suppressed,
or restrained (whatever be the temper of the public mind), through a
scrupulous dread, lest the tribute due to the past, should prove an
injurious incentive for the future. Every man, deserving the name of
Briton, adds his voice to the chorus which extols the exploits of his
countrymen, with a consciousness, at times overpowering the effort, that
they transcend all praise. But this particular sentiment, thus
irresistibly excited, is not sufficient. The nation would err
grievously, if she suffered the abuse which other states have made of
military power, to prevent her from perceiving that no people ever was,
or can be, independent, free, or secure, much less great, in any sane
application of the word, without martial propensities, and an assiduous
cultivation of military virtues<a name="FNanchor_AO_150" id="FNanchor_AO_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_AO_150" class="fnanchor">[AO]</a>. Nor let it be overlooked, that the
benefits derivable from these sources, are placed within the reach of
Great Britain, under conditions peculiarly favourable. The same insular
position which, by rendering territorial incorporation impossible,
utterly precludes the desire of conquest under the most seductive shape
it can assume, enables her to rely, for her defence against foreign
foes, chiefly upon a species of armed force from which her own liberties
have nothing to fear. Such are the blessed privileges of her situation;
and, by permitting, they invite her to give way to the courageous
instincts of human nature, and to strengthen and to refine them by
culture.</p>

<p>"But some have more than insinuated, that a design exists to subvert the
civil character of the English people by unconstitutional applications
and unnecessary increase of military power. The advisers and abettors of
such a design, were it possible that it should exist, would be guilty of
the most heinous crime, which, upon this planet, can be committed. The
author, trusting that this apprehension arises from the delusive
influences of an honourable jealousy, hopes that the martial qualities,
which he venerates, will be fostered by adhering to those good old
usages which experience has sanctioned; and by availing ourselves of new
means of indisputable promise; particularly by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>applying, in its
utmost possible extent, that system of tuition, of which the
master-spring is a habit of gradually enlightened subordination; by
imparting knowledge, civil, moral, and religious, in such measure that
the mind, among all classes of the community, may love, admire, and be
prepared and accomplished to defend that country, under whose protection
its faculties have been unfolded, and its riches acquired; by just
dealing towards all orders of the state, so that no members of it being
trampled upon, courage may everywhere continue to rest immoveably upon
its ancient English foundation, personal self-respect; by adequate
rewards, and permanent honours, conferred upon the deserving; by
encouraging athletic exercises and manly sports among the peasantry of
the country; and by especial care to provide and support sufficient
institutions, in which, during a time of peace, a reasonable proportion
of the youth of the country may be instructed in military science.</p>

<p>"Bent upon instant savings, a member of the House of Commons lately
recommended that the Military College should be suppressed as an
unnecessary expense; for, said he, 'our best officers have been formed
in the field.' More unwise advice has rarely been given! Admirable
officers, indeed, have been formed in the field, but at how deplorable
an expense of the lives of their surrounding brethren in arms, a history
of the military operations in Spain, and particularly of the sieges,
composed with thorough knowledge, and published without reserve, would
irresistibly demonstrate.<a name="FNanchor_AP_151" id="FNanchor_AP_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_AP_151" class="fnanchor">[AP]</a></p>

<p>"The author has only to add that he should feel little satisfaction in
giving to the world these limited attempts to celebrate the virtues of
his country, if he did not encourage a hope that a subject, which it has
fallen within his province to treat only in the mass, will by other
poets be illustrated in that detail which its importance calls for, and
which will allow opportunities to give the merited applause to <span class="smcap">persons</span>

<p>Replying to some criticism on this <cite>Ode</cite> by Southey, Wordsworth wrote
to his friend as follows:&mdash;"I am much of your mind in respect to my Ode.
Had it been a hymn, uttering the sentiments of a <em>multitude</em>, a
<em>stanza</em> would have been indispensable. But though I have called it a
'Thanksgiving Ode,' strictly speaking it is not so, but a poem,
composed, or supposed to be composed, on the morning of the
thanksgiving, uttering the sentiments of an <em>individual</em> upon that
occasion. It is a <em>dramatised ejaculation</em>; and this, if anything can,
must excuse the irregular frame of the metre. In respect to a <em>stanza</em>
for a grand subject designed to be treated comprehensively, there are
great objections. If the stanza be short, it will scarcely allow of
fervour and importunity, unless so short, as that the sense is run
perpetually from one stanza to another, as in Horace's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Alcaics; and if it be long, it will be as apt to generate diffuseness as
to check it. Of this we have innumerable instances in Spenser and the
Italian poets. The sense required cannot be included in one given
stanza, so that another whole stanza is added, not infrequently, for the
sake of matter which would naturally include itself in a very few lines.</p>

<p>"If Gray's plan be adopted, there is not time to become acquainted with
the arrangement, and to recognise with pleasure the recurrence of the
movement.</p>

<p>"Be so good as let me know where you found most difficulty in following
me. The passage which I most suspect of being misunderstood is</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">And thus is missed the sole true glory;</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>and the passage where I doubt most about the reasonableness of expecting
that the reader should follow me in the luxuriance of the imagery and
the language, is the one that describes, under so many metaphors, the
spreading of the news of the Waterloo victory over the globe."</p>

<p>The last reference in this letter is to the lines in that part of the
<cite>Ode</cite>, which follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Joyful annunciation!&mdash;it went forth&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">It pierced the caverns of the sluggish North, etc."</div>

<p>The date of the composition of this Ode is uncertain. Wordsworth
himself gives no clue: but it seems to refer to the rise of the
French Republic, with its illusive promises of Liberty: the freedom
of the many being sacrificed to the despotism of one. The Republic
passed "through many a change of form." It became both tyrannous and
aggressive. The "Principalities" of Europe "melted" before it. It
stood forth "an armèd creature," and "a terror to the Earth." It in
turn put down "Justice," "Faith," and "Hope" throughout Europe; and
the writer of the Ode says,</p>

<blockquote><p>How long shall vengeance sleep? Ye patient Heavens, how long?</p></blockquote>

<p>The allusions in stanza iv. suggest that this Ode was written before
Waterloo, and the final overthrow of the power of Napoleon, but it
is difficult, if not impossible, to determine the point with
exactness from internal evidence.</p>

<p>The reference in the last stanza may be to the legend of Amphion
moving stones, and building up the walls of Thebes, by the sound of
his lyre; the stones advancing to their places, and being fitted
together, as he played his instrument. Compare Tennyson's
<cite>Amphion</cite>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

the temperature suddenly fell to that of the most rigorous winter.
In that dreadful night thousands of men perished, and nearly all the
horses, which compelled the abandonment of the greater part of the

the cold was at 20 degrees of Réaumur." (Dyer's <cite>History of Modern

<p>See Filicaia's Canzone, addressed to (Sir) John Sobieski, king of
Poland, upon his raising the siege of Vienna. This, and his other poems
on the same occasion, are superior perhaps to any lyrical pieces that
contemporary events have ever given birth to, those of the Hebrew
Scriptures only excepted.&mdash;W. W. (1816 and 1820.)</p>

<p>Vienna, besieged in 1683 by Mahomet IV., was relieved by John Sobieski.
The following is Dyer's account of it in his <cite>Modern Europe</cite> (vol. iii.
p. 109):&mdash;"At one time Vienna seemed beyond the reach of human aid. The
Turks sat down before it on 14th July, and such were their numbers that
their encampment is said to have contained more than 100,000 tents. It
was the middle of August before John Sobieski could leave Cracow with
25,000 men, and by the end of that month the situation of Vienna had
become extremely critical. Provisions and ammunition began to fail; the
garrison had lost 6000 men, and numbers died every day by pestilence, or
at the hands of the enemy. It was not till 9th September that Sobieski
and his Poles formed a junction on the plain of Tuln with the Austrian
forces under the Duke of Lorraine, and the other German contingents. On
11th September, the allies reached the heights of Kahlenberg, within
sight of Vienna, and announced their arrival to the beleaguered citizens
by means of rockets. On the following day the Turks were attacked, and,
after a few hours' resistance, completely routed.... The Turkish camp,
with vast treasures in money, jewels, horses, arms, and ammunition,
became the spoil of the victors."</p>

<p>The Italian poet Filicaia referred to by Wordsworth (Filicaja,
Vincenzo), wrote six odes on the deliverance of Vienna by Sobieski. They
were published in Florence in the following year, 1684, and established
the writer's fame. Queen Christina of Sweden was much struck by them;
and, being a generous patroness and admirer of letters, she enabled
Filicaja to devote himself to poetry exclusively as his life-work. He
wrote numerous patriotic sonnets and heroic odes, in Italian and in
Latin.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>The Duc d'Enghien, grandson of the Prince de Condé, and only son of the
Duc de Bourbon, born at Chantilly in 1772, commanded the corps of
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Emigrés</i> gathered on the Rhine by his grandfather. After the peace of
Luneville, he retired to Ettenheim, near Strasburg, in German territory.
There he married the Princess Charlotte of Rohan-Rochefort, and lived
peacefully as a private citizen. He was, though wholly innocent,
suspected by Napoleon of complicity in the plot of Pichegru, Cadoudal
(one of the Chouans), Moreau, and others, to overthrow him as first
Consul, and to restore the Bourbon dynasty. "The Duke was residing at
Ettenheim, in the neutral territory of Baden, when Bonaparte, in
violation of international law and the rights of the German Empire,
caused him to be seized on the night of 15th March by a party of French
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">gens d'armes</i>, and to be carried to the castle of Vincennes, where,
after a sort of mock trial, he was shot in the fosse of the fortress,
March 21st" (1804).&mdash;Dyer's <cite>Modern Europe</cite> (vol. iv. p. 378). The whole
of the proceedings against the Duc d'Enghien were illegal (as was
confessed by the presiding judge), and his execution was one of the
blackest stains on the character of Napoleon. After the Restoration, in
1814, his remains were disinterred by order of Louis XVIII., and buried
in the chapel of the castle at Vincennes, where the restored king
erected a monument to his memory. The "pit of vilest mould" mentioned in
the sonnet, is, of course, the moat of the castle, and the phrase "to
lodge among ancestral kings," refers to Vincennes having been a royal
residence, where many princes died and were buried, <em>e.g.</em> Queen Jeanne
(wife of Philippe le Bel), Louis le Hutin, and Charles le Bel. Vincennes
is close to Paris, the fortress being only about five miles south-east
of the Louvre. The chapel, which has a fine Gothic front, was begun in
1248, and was finished in 1552. The monument to the Duc d'Enghien is in
the old Sacristy. It consists of four figures in marble, representing
the <em>Duke</em>, supported by <em>Religion</em> and bewailed by <em>France</em>, while
<em>Vengeance</em> waits behind. It was executed by Deseine.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>In the Fenwick note to <cite>An Evening Walk</cite>, vol. i. p. 5, after describing
the two pairs of swans that frequented the lake of Esthwaite, Wordsworth
says: "It was from the remembrance of those noble creatures, I took,
thirty years after, the picture of the swan which I have discarded from
the poem of <cite>Dion</cite>." After quoting the note, which explains the
discarding of the above stanza, Professor Henry Reed remarks, "It is a
remarkable instance of the comparative sacrifice of a passage of great
beauty to the poet's dutiful regard for the principles of his Art"
(American edition of 1851, p. 415). Wordsworth's reasons for withdrawing
the stanza are obvious; but it is perhaps not unworthy of mention that
when I was editing a volume of <cite>Selections from Wordsworth</cite>, to which
many members of "The Wordsworth Society" contributed, Robert Browning
besought me, in the strongest terms, to restore that discarded
stanza.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>From 1820 to 1843 <cite>Dion</cite> was classed among the "Poems of Sentiment and
Reflection." In the edition of 1845 it was placed next to <cite>Laodamia</cite>
among the "Poems of the Imagination."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>Some years ago I was inclined to assign this poem to the year 1814,
because Wordsworth himself gave it that date in one of the notes which
he dictated to Miss Fenwick in 1843. I now assign it to the year 1816.
Wordsworth gave it that date in the year 1837, and if written in 1814, I
think it would have been included in the edition of 1815.</p>

<p><cite>Dion</cite>, the <cite>Ode to Lycoris</cite>, and the translation of part of Virgil's
<cite>Æneid</cite>, belong to a time when Wordsworth had reverted to the subjects
of ancient classical literature while preparing his eldest son for the
University.</p>

<p>Charles Lamb wrote thus to Dorothy Wordsworth in 1820:&mdash;"The story of
Dion is divine&mdash;the genius of Plato falling on him like moonlight&mdash;the
finest thing ever expressed." (<cite>The Letters of Charles Lamb</cite>, edited by
Alfred Ainger, vol. ii. p. 56.)</p>

<p>I am indebted to the Headmaster of Fettes College, the Rev. W. A. Heard,
for the following notes on the poem, with special reference to Plutarch.
They reveal, as Mr. Heard remarks, "Wordsworth's method of work upon the
authors he had read and studied, and show upon what a solid structure of
fact he always wrote." It will be observed that he invariably appended
to the title of this poem "(See Plutarch)."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"When Dion, the pupil of Plato, became the autocrat of Syracuse, it
seemed as if the moment had come for the rule of a philosopher. But the
gardens of the Academy knew nothing of the methods by which alone
intrigue could be met and unscrupulousness baffled. The murder of
Heracleides became a political necessity; but when this was conceded,
the charm was once and for ever broken&mdash;the career was done. Plutarch's
biography deals mainly with the external conditions, and is overlaid
with so much historical detail that the personality of Dion stands out
in insufficient relief. Wordsworth gives us a study of the internal
struggle, showing us the failure of an ideal, not in its external
aspect, but as closing the aspirations, and desolating the conscience,
of a truly noble mind. He accepts Plutarch's general conception of the
life, incorporating much of the details and adopting some of the
language, but over and above the fresh emphasis he gives to critical
moments, the imaginative insight with which all the detail is treated
makes the poem an original presentation.</p>

<p>ὑψηλὀς τῷ ἠθει καὶ μεγαλόφρων.&mdash;'He was lofty in his
disposition and large-minded.' Again, Plutarch speaks of the "σεμνότης"&mdash;the
'still magnificence' of his nature, coupled with "τὸ γενναίον

<p>Perhaps the idea of Ilissus bending over the urn is taken from the
western pediment of the Parthenon. At one angle there is a recumbent

seems to have been a ὑδρια attached to one of them. See <cite>Guide

<p>Dion was anxious to give Syracuse a constitution, but he found
Heracleides an incessant opponent in spite of the long forbearance he
had shown him. Feeling that the one obstacle to a settlement must at all
costs be removed, he yielded to advisers whom he had long withstood, and
allowed them to put Heracleides to death. He gave him, however, a public
funeral, and persuaded the people that it was impossible for the State
to have peace on any other conditions.</p>

οἰκίας μόνος ὥν πρὸς ἑαυτῷ τὴν διάνοιαν' ἐξαίφνης δὲ ψόφου
γενομένου πρὸς θατέρῳ πέρατι τῆς στοᾶς, ἀποβλέψας ἕτι φωτὸς

corridor of the house in solitary meditation: suddenly a sound was
heard in the further end of the portico, and looking up, he saw in
the lingering light the form of a majestic woman, in dress and face
like the Fury as she appears in tragedy&mdash;sweeping the house with
a brush.</p>

<p>In Plutarch, the apparition is simply ominous of coming evil, his son, a
few days afterwards, throwing himself in a fit of petulance from the
roof of the palace, and his own death shortly following: the moral
significance assigned to it in the poem is Wordsworth's own
interpretation.</p>

<div class="poem">

  <div class="i0"><em>And, in their anguish, bear what other minds have borne!</em></div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>In Plutarch, Dion calls his attendants, dreading to be left alone for
fear the spectre should return (παντἀπασιν ἐκστατικῶς ἕχων καὶ
δεδοικὼς μὴ πάλιν εἰς ὅψιν αὐτῷ μονωθέν τὸ τέρας ἀφίκηται).
Wordsworth seems to have taken a hint from this passage, and to have
added a tragic intensity by representing the horror as one which he
could share with no one, a supernatural doom in which he must be
absolutely solitary.</p>

<p>Callippus, an early friend of Dion's in Athens, and bound to him by a
sacred association as he had initiated him into the mysteries, was now
in Syracuse, and for selfish ends was plotting his friend's ruin,
ἐλπίσας Σικελίαν ἆθλον ἕξειν τῆς ξενοκτονίας, 'hoping to get
Sicily as the prize of his treachery.'</p>

</div>

<p>Not only was this Callippus his friend, not only had he initiated him
into the mysteries at Athens, a bond of peculiar sanctity, but there was
even a worse perfidy: to allay the suspicions of Dion's household he had
taken '<em>the awful oath</em>'. Descending into the sacred enclosure of
Demeter, he had put on the purple robe of the goddess, and taking a
burning torch in his hand, had disowned upon oath any thought of
treachery. Yet in spite of this awful oath, he chose the very festival
of the goddess as the moment for perpetrating the crime.</p>

His relations had been cautioning him against Callippus; but 'Dion,
grieved at heart, it would seem, at the fate of Heracleides, and
ever chafing at and brooding over the murder as a stain upon his
life and conduct, was willing, he said, to die a thousand deaths and
yield his neck to any who would strike the blow, if life was only to
be had by guarding against friends as well as foes.'"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>The passage from Milton's <cite>History of England</cite> (book vi.),
referred to in the Fenwick note, relates an incident, "which"
(as Milton justly says), "unless to Court-Parasites, needed no
such laborious demonstration." There is only one expression
borrowed by Wordsworth: "The Sea, as before, came rolling
on, ... whereat the King, quickly rising, wished all
about him to behold and consider the weak and frivolous
form of a King, and that none indeed deserved the name of a
King, but he whose Eternal Laws both Heaven, Earth, and
Sea obey."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h3>ODE TO LYCORIS</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">May, 1817</span></p>

<p class="center">Composed 1817.&mdash;Published 1820</p>

<blockquote><p>[The discerning reader&mdash;who is aware that in the poem of
<cite>Ellen Irwin</cite> I was desirous of throwing the reader at once out
of the old ballad, so as if possible, to preclude a comparison
between that mode of dealing with the subject and the mode I
meant to adopt&mdash;may here perhaps perceive that this poem
originated in the four last lines of the first stanza. Those specks
of snow, reflected in the lake and so transferred, as it were,
to the subaqueous sky, reminded me of the swans which the
fancy of the ancient classic poets yoked to the car of Venus.
Hence the tenor of the whole first stanza, and the name of
Lycoris, which&mdash;with some readers who think my theology and
classical allusion too far fetched and therefore more or less
unnatural and affected&mdash;will tend to unrealise the sentiment
that pervades these verses. But surely one who has written so
much in verse as I have done may be allowed to retrace his
steps in the regions of fancy which delighted him in his boyhood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
when he first became acquainted with the Greek and
Roman poets. Before I read Virgil I was so strongly attached
to Ovid, whose <cite>Metamorphoses</cite> I read at school, that I was
quite in a passion whenever I found him, in books of criticism,
placed below Virgil. As to Homer, I was never weary of
travelling over the scenes through which he led me. Classical
literature affected me by its own beauty. But the truths of
Scripture having been entrusted to the dead languages, and
these fountains having recently been laid open at the Reformation,
an importance and a sanctity were at that period attached
to classical literature that extended, as is obvious in Milton's
<cite>Lycidas</cite> for example, both to its spirit and form in a degree that
can never be revived. No doubt the hacknied and lifeless use
into which mythology fell towards the close of the 17th century,
and which continued through the 18th, disgusted the general
reader with all allusion to it in modern verse; and though, in
deference to this disgust, and also in a measure participating in
it, I abstained in my earlier writings from all introduction of
pagan fable, surely, even in its humble form, it may ally itself
with real sentiment, as I can truly affirm it did in the present
case.&mdash;I. F.]</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the "Poems of Sentiment and Reflection." In 1847
Wordsworth wrote to Mr. Fletcher that this poem was "suggested
to him one day at Ullswater, in the year 1817, by seeing
two white, snowy clouds reflected in the lake. 'They looked'
(he said), 'like two swans.'"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h3>TO THE SAME</h3>

<p class="center">Composed 1817.&mdash;Published 1820</p>

<blockquote><p>[This, as well as the preceding and the two that follow,<a name="FNanchor_CR_353" id="FNanchor_CR_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_CR_353" class="fnanchor">[CR]</a>
were composed in front of Rydal Mount, and during my walks
in the neighbourhood. Nine-tenths of my verses have been
murmured out in the open air: and here let me repeat what I
believe has already appeared in print. One day a stranger
having walked round the garden and grounds of Rydal Mount
asked one of the female servants, who happened to be at the
door, permission to see her master's study. "This," said she,
leading him forward, "is my master's library where he keeps
his books, but his study is out of doors." After a long absence
from home it has more than once happened that some one of
my cottage neighbours has said&mdash;"Well, there he is; we are
glad to hear him <em>booing</em> about again." Once more in excuse
for so much egotism let me say, these notes are written for my
familiar friends, and at their earnest request. Another time a
gentleman whom James had conducted through the grounds
asked him what kind of plants throve best there: after a little
consideration he answered&mdash;"Laurels." "That is," said the
stranger, "as it should be; don't you know that the laurel is
the emblem of poetry, and that poets used on public occasions
to be crowned with it?" James stared when the question was
first put, but was doubtless much pleased with the information.&mdash;I.F.]</p>

<p>The spot described in this sequel to <cite>Lycoris</cite> is, I think, the
bower in the rock on Nab Scar, alluded to in Dorothy Wordsworth's
Grasmere Journal (see note to <cite>The Waterfall and the
Eglantine</cite>, vol. ii. p. 172). The description in that Journal,
taken in connection with the text of this poem, warrants the
suggestion that the "Friend" with whom he had "known such
happy hours together" was his own sister Dorothy. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
extreme probability that it was on Nab Scar that the snow
patches lay, which were reflected in Rydal mere, and which his
imagination transformed into the swans that carried Venus' car
through heaven, adds to the likelihood of this conjecture. The
following extracts from the Sister's journal may be compared
with passages in the poem:&mdash;"We pushed on to the foot of
the Scar. It was very grand when we looked up, very stony....
Coleridge went to search for something new. We saw
him climbing up towards a rock. He called us, and we found
him in a bower,&mdash;the sweetest that was ever seen. The rock
on one side is very high, and all covered with ivy, which hung
loosely about, and bore bunches of brown berries." With this
compare&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Yon wild cave, whose jaggèd brows are fringed</div>
  <div class="i0">With flaccid threads of ivy, in the still</div>
  <div class="i0">And sultry air, depending motionless.</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And with the following, "We looked down on the Ambleside
vale, that seemed to wind away from us, the village lying under
the hill," compare&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Mount toward the empire of the fickle clouds,</div>
  <div class="i0">Each weary step, dwarfing the world below.</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>With the following, "It is scarce a bower, a little parlour only,
not enclosed by walls, but shaped out for a resting-place by the
rocks, and the ground rising about it. It had a sweet moss
carpet," compare l. 14&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Moss-grown alleys, circumscribing shades.</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Doubtless Wordsworth drew on his imagination, "making a
truth and beauty of his own," in this, as in every other description
of place, which has a local colouring in it; but to connect
"the dim cave" of the <cite>Ode to Lycoris</cite> with these conversations
between Coleridge and the Wordsworths&mdash;mentioned in the
Grasmere Journal of the latter, and hinted at in the closing
passage of the Ode&mdash;is certainly permissible.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h3>LAMENT OF MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS</h3>

<p class="center">Composed 1817.&mdash;Published 1820</p>

<blockquote><p>[This arose out of a flash of moonlight that struck the
ground when I was approaching the steps that lead from the
garden at Rydal Mount to the front of the house. "From her
sunk eyes a stagnant tear stole forth" is taken, with some loss,
from a discarded poem, <cite>The Convict</cite>, in which occurred,
when he was discovered lying in the cell, these lines:&mdash;</p>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">But now he upraises the deep-sunken eye,</div>
  <div class="i1">The motion unsettles a tear;</div>

a critic, in some review or other, crying out against this piece.

glow-worm!" Poor fellow! we know from this sage observation
what the "primrose on the river's brim" was to him.&mdash;I. F.]</p>

<p>It is impossible to say where the "spring of the Hermitage"
was, or was supposed by Wordsworth to be. It may refer to
some Rydalian retreat. There is no spring or "crystal well" on
St. Herbert's Island, Derwentwater; but Inscription XIII. in the

<p class="center">Composed 1818.&mdash;Published 1820</p>

<blockquote><p>[Felt, and in a great measure composed, upon the little
mount in front of our abode at Rydal. In concluding my
notices of this class of poems, it may be as well to observe that
among the "Miscellaneous Sonnets" are a few alluding to
morning impressions, which might be read with mutual benefit,
in connection with these "Evening Voluntaries." See, for
example, that one on Westminster Bridge, that composed on a
May Morning, the one on the Song of the Thrush, and that
beginning&mdash;"While beams of orient light shoot wide and
high."&mdash;I. F.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1820 this was one of the "Poems of the Imagination."
In 1837 it was transferred to the "Evening Voluntaries."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>The phrase "men of genius" includes Haydon. The first part of this
note of 1820, being one on <cite>Peter Bell</cite>, referring to Haydon's Bible picture
of Christ's Entry into Jerusalem. (See note to <cite>Peter Bell</cite>, l. 979.)</p>

<p>The American painter was Mr. Washington Allston. Wordsworth
sent him a MS. copy of the poem, transcribed "in gratitude for the
pleasure he had received from the sight of Mr. Allston's pictures, in particular
'Jacob's Dream,'" and at the end of the MS. of his poem, Wordsworth
wrote, "The Author does not know how far he was indebted to Mr. Allston
for part of the 3rd stanza. The multiplication of ridges in a mountainous
country, as Mr. A. has probably observed, arises from two causes, sunny or
watery vapour&mdash;the former is here meant. When does Mr. A. return to
England?" In a letter on "Wordsworth and Allston," in <cite>The Athenæum</cite>,
Mr. J. Dykes Campbell refers to "something in the picture having given
definite form to observations of natural phenomena the significance of which
the poet had not immediately noted." "Wordsworth," he adds, "was a
close and untiring rather than a quick or keen observer, and his mind
was at all times stored with a wealth of notes which sometimes had to wait
long before they could either be worked out or worked in. Sometimes&mdash;as in
this instance, perhaps&mdash;they were revivified by the suggestions of some
kindred observer who happened to anticipate the poet in giving them form."&mdash;See

<h2><a name="EIGHTEEN_NINETEEN" id="EIGHTEEN_NINETEEN"></a>1819</h2>


<p>With the exception of <cite>The Haunted Tree</cite>, and the lines
entitled <cite>September 1819</cite>, all the poems composed during the
year 1819 were sonnets. Four of the latter were published
along with <cite>Peter Bell</cite>, in the first edition of that poem; and
other twelve, along with <cite>The Waggoner</cite>, which was first
published in the same year. One of the twelve refers to the
Old Hall of Donnerdale, and belongs to the series of <cite>Sonnets
on the River Duddon</cite>, where it will be found (No. <span class="smcap">XXVII.</span>) It
was first published, along with those referring to Rydal, in the
volume of 1819, and probably detached from the rest of the
series, because originally it had no particular reference to the
Old Hall in the Duddon Valley; but was (as Wordsworth
indicates in the third of the Fenwick notes to the Duddon)
"taken from a tradition belonging to Rydal Hall, which once
stood, as is believed, upon a rocky and woody hill on the right
hand as you go from Rydal to Ambleside, and was deserted
from the superstitious fear here described, and the present site
fortunately chosen instead."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>Malham Cove is a noble amphitheatre of perpendicular
limestone rock, lying in regular strata, the height being 300
feet in the centre. The Aire issues from the rock at the base
of the cliff, a considerable stream. Possibly Westall's picture
of Malham Cove suggested to Wordsworth the Giant's Causeway
in Ireland, and its legend. They have the same columnar
appearance; although the former is limestone, and the latter
basalt.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>There are many legendary stories connected with the Yorkshire
caves, particularly in the Giggleswick district; but I
have been unable to trace any legend about the "local Deity"
of Gordale. There is nothing in the letterpress of Westall's
views, or in the "addenda" to West's <cite>Guide to the Lakes in
Cumberland</cite>, about these legends. The chasm is a very remarkable
cleft in the limestone rock, near Malham. Gray's description
of Gordale, in his <cite>Journal</cite> (1796), may be referred to.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h3>"GRIEF, THOU HAST LOST AN EVER READY
FRIEND"</h3>

<p class="center">Composed 1819.&mdash;Published 1819</p>

<blockquote><p>[I could write a treatise of lamentation upon the changes
brought about among the cottages of Westmoreland by the
silence of the spinning-wheel.<a name="FNanchor_DR_506" id="FNanchor_DR_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_DR_506" class="fnanchor">[DR]</a> During long winter nights and
wet days, the wheel upon which wool was spun gave employment
to a great part of a family. The old man, however infirm,
was able to card the wool, as he sate in a corner by the
fire-side; and often, when a boy, have I admired the cylinders
of carded wool which were softly laid upon each other by his
side. Two wheels were often at work on the same floor; and
others of the family, chiefly little children, were occupied in
teasing and cleaning the wool to fit it for the hand of the carder.
So that all, except the smallest infants, were contributing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
mutual support. Such was the employment that prevailed in
the pastoral vales. Where wool was not at hand, in the small
rural towns, the wheel for spinning flax was almost in as
constant use, if knitting was not preferred; which latter
occupation has the advantage (in some cases disadvantage) that,
not being of necessity stationary, it allowed of gossiping about
from house to house, which good housewives reckoned an idle
thing.&mdash;I. F.]</p>

<p>Socrates to Simmias.&mdash;"Will you not allow that I have as
much of the spirit of prophecy in me as the swans? For they,
when they perceive that they must die, having sung all their
life long, do then sing more than ever, rejoicing in the thought
that they are about to go away to the God, whose ministers they
are. But men, because they are themselves afraid of death,
slanderously affirm of the swans, that they sing a lament at the
last, not considering that no bird sings when cold, or hungry,
or in pain, not even the nightingale, nor the swallow, nor yet
the hoopoe, which are said indeed to tune a lay of sorrow,
although I do not believe this to be true of them any more than
of the swans. But because they are sacred to Apollo, they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the gift of prophecy, and anticipate the good things of another
world; wherefore they sing and rejoice in that day more than
ever they did before. And I too, believing myself to be the
consecrated servant of the same God, and the fellow-servant of
the swans, and thinking that I have received from my master
gifts of prophecy which are not inferior to theirs, would not go
out of life less merrily than the swans." <cite>Phædo</cite>, 85 (Jowett's

<p>Where this <cite>Haunted Tree</cite> stood in Rydal Park, or whether
it is still standing, cannot be determined. There are several
"time-dismantled oaks" in the Park, but none with a heather
couch beneath them, so far as I know. I have, however, heard
stories of this tree from old residenters. The "Lady," the
"lovely wanderer of the trackless hills," may have been the
poet's daughter, Dora, to whom (probably) this poem was
inscribed.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_EF_532" id="Footnote_EF_532"></a><a href="#FNanchor_EF_532"><span class="label">[EF]</span></a> Simonides, of Ceos, perfected Greek elegy and epigram, a "brilliant
representative not only of Greek choral poetry in its prime, but of the whole
literary life of Hellas during the period which immediately preceded and
followed the Persian war." We find in him "a Dorian solemnity of
thought and feeling, which qualified him for commemorating in elegy and
epigram and funereal ode the achievements of Hellas against Persia....
The genius of Simonides is unique in this branch of monumental poetry
(epigram). His couplets&mdash;calm, simple, terse, strong as the deeds they
celebrate, enduring as the brass or stone which they adorned&mdash;animated
succeeding generations of Greek patriots." (Symonds, <cite>Studies of the Greek
Poets</cite>, 1st Series, pp. 146-149.) The phrase "pure Simonides" probably
refers to his reputation&mdash;which was proverbial&mdash;for σωφροσύνη, that temperance
and restraint, that moderation and self-control which are seen both in
his poems and in his reputed sayings as a philosopher.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_EH_534" id="Footnote_EH_534"></a><a href="#FNanchor_EH_534"><span class="label">[EH]</span></a> I have been unable to find any allusion to Simonides in Virgil. But
probably Wordsworth merely refers to the numerous lost books of Greek and
Latin literature; and wonders if these treasures (of all kinds), which Horace
and Virgil knew and prized, would ever be recovered by us. Some of
Horace's most significant references to the literature of Greece, and of the
past, occur in <cite>Odes</cite> <span class="smcap">III.</span> 3; iv. 2 and 3.</p>

<p>Since the above was written, the late Professor William Sellar wrote to
me:&mdash;"I do not find any special reference to Simonides in Virgil. Besides
the passages you refer to in Horace, there are two or three lines in the <cite>Odes</cite>,
which he has translated from Simonides, <em>e.g.</em></p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Est et fideli tuta silentio</div>
  <div class="i0">Merces: <span style="margin-left: 6em;">(<cite>Carmina</cite> <span class="smcap">III.</span> ii. 25)</span></div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>but I think Wordsworth's reference is quite vague. It is quite appropriate
so far, that it was only in the Augustan age that the Romans got back
to the great sources of Greek poetry, and one cause of the superiority of
Virgil and Horace to all their contemporaries was that they did this much
more thoroughly than the others, and appreciated the purest and oldest of
these sources. Horace's special study was of course the whole range of
Greek lyric poetry. He no doubt acknowledges his relation to Sappho and
Alcæus more than to Simonides, but he recognises him as well as Pindar
among the Masters of lyrical poetry. So far as one can judge by the
fragments of Simonides' lyrical poetry, I should say that his characteristics
were tenderness, piety, and purity; and, in these respects, he has a strong
affinity with Virgil, which may explain their association together by Wordsworth.
The passage quoted by you is very interesting, as showing how
Wordsworth&mdash;the most essentially modern and least conventional of poets&mdash;regarded
Virgil and Horace, who have often been disparaged as types of
conventionalism.... It would be very interesting to bring together the
various passages in which Wordsworth draws from the sources of classical
poetry. His reminiscences of Latin poetry seem to me to have a peculiar
freshness, different from the more direct reproduction of Milton, Gray,
etc."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<h2><a name="EIGHTEEN_TWENTY" id="EIGHTEEN_TWENTY"></a>1820</h2>


<p>The following poems may be assigned to the year 1820.
<cite>The River Duddon, a series of Sonnets</cite>, the Ode <cite>To Enterprise</cite>,
some of the <cite>Memorials of a Tour on the Continent</cite>, and a number
of <cite>Miscellaneous Sonnets</cite>. Several of the Duddon Sonnets were
composed in previous years, and one of them was published as
early as 1807; but, as the volume containing the entire series was
published in 1820&mdash;and the dedication was written on Christmas
Eve of that year&mdash;the whole has been assigned to 1820. In
localising the allusions in these sonnets, I have been greatly
indebted to Mr. Herbert Rix, whose paper contributed to the
"Transactions of the Wordsworth Society" was only the first of a
Series of admirable studies of the Duddon. I have also been
greatly indebted to Canon Rawnsley. Most of the "Memorials"
of the Continental Tour were written during the journey; and,
although they were not finished till 1822&mdash;the year of publication&mdash;I
think their chronological place should be in the year 1820.
In connection with these poems, I have had the advantage of
perusing the two singularly interesting Journals of the Tour,
written by Mrs. Wordsworth, and by the poet's sister Dorothy.
Both of these were written, in the form of notes or "memoranda,"
during the journey. Miss Wordsworth's was expanded from
these earlier jottings, two months after her return to Rydal
Mount; and added to, as late as December 1821. In the case
of each poem, illustrative extracts are given from these two
Journals; and it will be seen that they cast much light on the
incidents which gave rise to the Memorial Verses, and the
circumstances under which they were composed. The poet's
wish that these journals should be published, at least in part, is
expressed in the Fenwick note, which precedes the sonnet
beginning, "What lovelier home could gentle Fancy choose?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
p. 294; and Mrs. Wordsworth, in a letter to Mr. John Kenyon&mdash;dated
28th December 1821&mdash;after referring to her husband's
being "busily engaged upon subjects connected with our
Continental Journey," says, "Miss W. is going on with her
Journal, which will be ready to go to press interspersed with
her brother's Poems I hope before your return." She adds,
however, "I do not say this seriously, but we sometimes
jestingly talk of raising a fund by such means, for a second
and a farther trip into Italy." The diary and correspondence of
Henry Crabb Robinson is also of use in determining some
points connected with this Continental Journey, in which he
accompanied the Wordsworths.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_EM_553" id="Footnote_EM_553"></a><a href="#FNanchor_EM_553"><span class="label">[EM]</span></a> The event is thus recorded in the journals of the day:&mdash;"When the
Austrians took Hockheim, in one part of the engagement they got to the
brow of the hill, whence they had their first view of the Rhine. They
instantly halted&mdash;not a gun was fired&mdash;not a voice heard: but they stood
gazing on the river with those feelings which the events of the last 15 years
at once called up. Prince Schwartzenberg rode up to know the cause of
this sudden stop, they then gave three cheers, rushed after the enemy, and
drove them into the water."&mdash;W. W. 1822.</p>

<p>The only reference which Dorothy Wordsworth makes to Hockheim in
her Journal of the Tour on the Continent (1820) is as follows:&mdash;July 25th.&mdash;"We
had a magnificent prospect down the Rhine into the Reingaw, stretching
towards Bingen. Hockheim is on the right bank, nearly opposite to
Mayence. The broad hills are enlivened by hamlets, villas, villages, and
churches."</p>

<p>Prince Schwartzenberg, referred to in Wordsworth's own note, was
Generalissimo of the allied armies of Austria, Prussia, Bavaria, and Russia,
who were victors in the battle of Leipsic in 1813. The retreat of the
French towards the Rhine after that battle was almost as disastrous to them
as the retreat from Moscow in the previous winter. The incident described
in the sonnet doubtless occurred during this retreat, when the French were
driven across the Rhine in November 1813.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<h3>THE RIVER DUDDON</h3>

<p class="center">A SERIES OF SONNETS</p>

<p class="center">Composed 1820.&mdash;Published 1820</p>

<blockquote><p>[It is with the little river Duddon as it is with most other
rivers, Ganges and Nile not excepted,&mdash;many springs might
claim the honour of being its head. In my own fancy I have
fixed its rise near the noted Shire-stones placed at the meeting-point
of the counties, Westmoreland, Cumberland, and Lancashire.
They stand by the way side on the top of the Wrynose
Pass, and it used to be reckoned a proud thing to say that, by
touching them at the same time with feet and hands, one had
been in the three counties at once. At what point of its
course the stream takes the name of Duddon I do not know.
I first became acquainted with the Duddon, as I have good
reason to remember, in early boyhood. Upon the banks of the
Derwent I had learnt to be very fond of angling. Fish abound
in that large river; not so in the small streams in the
neighbourhood of Hawkshead; and I fell into the common
delusion that the farther from home the better sport
would be had. Accordingly, one day I attached myself to a
person living in the neighbourhood of Hawkshead, who was
going to try his fortune as an angler near the source of the
Duddon. We fished a great part of the day with very sorry
success, the rain pouring torrents, and long before we got home
I was worn out with fatigue; and, if the good man had not
carried me on his back, I must have lain down under the best
shelter I could find. Little did I think then it would be my
lot to celebrate, in a strain of love and admiration, the stream
which for many years I never thought of without recollections
of disappointment and distress.</p>

<p>During my college vacation, and two or three years afterwards,
before taking my Bachelor's degree, I was several times
resident in the house of a near relative who lived in the small
town of Broughton. I passed many delightful hours upon the
banks of this river, which becomes an estuary about a mile
from that place. The remembrances of that period are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
subject of the 21st sonnet. The subject of the 27th is in fact
taken from a tradition belonging to Rydal Hall, which once
stood, as is believed, upon a rocky and woody hill on the right
hand as you go from Rydal to Ambleside, and was deserted
from the superstitious fear here described, and the present site
fortunately chosen instead. The present hall was erected by
Sir Michael le Fleming, and it may be hoped that at some
future time there will be an edifice more worthy of so beautiful
a position. With regard to the 30th sonnet it is odd enough
that this imagination was realised in the year 1840 when I
made a tour through that district with my wife and daughter,
Miss Fenwick and her niece, and Mr. and Mrs. Quillinan.
Before our return from Seathwaite Chapel the party separated.
Mrs. Wordsworth, while most of us went further up the stream,
chose an opposite direction, having told us that we should
overtake her on our way to Ulpha. But she was tempted out
of the main road to ascend a rocky eminence near it, thinking
it impossible we should pass without seeing her. This, however,
unfortunately happened, and then ensued vexation and
distress, especially to me, which I should be ashamed to have
recorded, for I lost my temper entirely. Neither I nor those
that were with me saw her again till we reached the Inn at
Broughton, seven miles. This may perhaps in some degree
excuse my irritability on the occasion, for I could not but think
she had been much to blame. It appeared, however, on
explanation that she had remained on the rock, calling out and
waving her handkerchief as we were passing, in order that we
also might ascend and enjoy a prospect which had much
charmed her. "But on we went, her signals proving vain."
How then could she reach Broughton before us? When we
found she had not gone on before to Ulpha Kirk, Mr. Quillinan
went back in one of the carriages in search of her. He met
her on the road, took her up, and by a shorter way conveyed
her to Broughton, where we were all re-united and spent a
happy evening.</p>

<p>I have many affecting remembrances connected with this
stream. Those I forbear to mention; especially things that
occurred on its banks during the later part of that visit to the
sea-side, of which the former part is detailed in my Epistle to
Sir George Beaumont.&mdash;I. F.]</p></blockquote>

<p><a name="Footnote_EW_586" id="Footnote_EW_586"></a><a href="#FNanchor_EW_586"><span class="label">[EW]</span></a> Mr. Herbert Rix&mdash;late Assistant Secretary to the Royal Society&mdash;has
made a very minute and careful study of the Duddon Valley&mdash;repeated during
many seasons&mdash;with the object of localising the allusions in the sonnets.
I am indebted to him for the following notes, which bear his name.</p>

<p>The Rev. Canon Rawnsley has also studied the Duddon Valley with great
care, and I place his comments beside those of Mr. Rix, both when they are
supplementary, and when they differ from the conclusions come to by Mr.
Rix.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>"The Duddon rises on Wrynose Fell, near to the 'Three-Shire Stone,'
where Westmoreland, Cumberland, and Lancashire meet, though which of
the rills descending from the heights above Wrynose Gap and uniting to
form the streamlet which flows along the pass, is to be regarded as the ultimate
source, or which of them the poet may have followed, it would perhaps be
difficult to say. More than one takes its rise in just such a spot as we find
described in the second and third sonnets, where the 'lofty waste' is haunted
by the Spirit of 'Desolation,' where the 'whistling blast' sweeps bleakly by,
and where 'naked stones,' such as the poet chose for his seat, are scattered
all around. James Thorne, in his <cite>Rambles by Rivers</cite> (London, 1844, p. 10),
has given a rough woodcut of the source of the Duddon." (Herbert Rix.)</p>

<p>"I was fortunate in seeking the 'birth-place of a native stream' after a
very heavy fall of rain, and I followed the left hand branch to a basin, from
which in winter time a full stream must pass with force, to judge by the deep
channel-bed of white and bleached stones which the water has carved out of
the peat-moss for itself. There was the clear height, and from it was seen
quite distinctly Brathay Vale, and a glimpse of Duddon Vale at Cockley
Beck, and of Windermere Lake below Lowwood, and the bare Yorkshire
hills far away to the east-south-east." (H. D. Rawnsley.)</p>

before rounding the brow of the hill. The path drops somewhat suddenly,
so that two or three steps bring the traveller from a level whence looking
backward the 'sinuous lapse' of the stream may be seen for some distance,
to a stage where it is entirely hidden from view. Or, more likely, the
'sinuous lapse' is that which lies below the spectator, as he stands at this
point of vantage, and looks down into Wrynose Bottom. The 'Protean
change' is then the contrast between the 'cradled Nursling' as the poet
looks back into Wrynose Gap, and the 'loosely-scattered chain' or 'glittering
snake' which he sees below him, as he turns and looks down into Wrynose
Bottom. These similes are accurately descriptive of the river so seen,
especially towards evening when the western light is on the water. From
this point the Duddon descends to the valley by a quick series of falls. The
first of these falls&mdash;a very pretty cascade just at the edge of the hill&mdash;is
probably the 'dizzy steep' mentioned in the sonnet." (Herbert Rix.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

Stones to Cockley Beck, I constantly found myself repeating Sonnet number
<span class="smcap">IV</span>.</p>

<p>The stream seemed now 'a loosely-scattered chain to make,' now to
'appear a glittering snake,' silently 'thridding with sinuous lapse the rushes,
through' (if we might call the bog-myrtle bushes dwarf willows) 'dwarf
willows gliding, and by ferny brake.'</p>

<p>I regained the main road, and took a parting, 'no negligent adieu' at the
'cradled nursling'; and saw the cascade at the grotto&mdash;wherefrom I first
began to track the 'nursling' to its upland cradle&mdash;as white as snow in May.
There, thought I, is the sight that suggested the line&mdash;</p>

  <div class="i0">Starts from a dizzy steep the undaunted Rill.</div>

<p>But, if the poet had needed suggestion of such a picture, and he had been
at my side, he would have seen in three other directions, from the place
where I was standing, three 'cataracts blowing their trumpets from the
steep.' And I could have been induced to follow three other streams up into
the Fells towards the north for the birth-place of the 'cradled nursling.'</p>

<p>As I descended towards Cockley Beck I constantly looked for the
'rushes,' the 'dwarf willows,' and the 'ferny brake,' spoken of in Sonnet
IV., constantly looked for some other spot where I might take a 'parting
glance' of the stream, which would satisfy the requirements of the description
in Sonnet IV.; but I found none.</p>

<p>One thing is worth mentioning. Wordsworth is describing the Duddon as
a Cumberland stream, <em>his native stream</em>, and he is accurate as ever. For
one is struck, in descending from the Three Shire Stones to Cockley Beck, at
the way in which all the feeders of the Duddon rise to the north on the
Cumbrian Fells, and how comparatively waterless are the slopes of Grey
Friars, on the southern or Lancashire side of the pass." (H. D. Rawnsley.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_FC_597" id="Footnote_FC_597"></a><a href="#FNanchor_FC_597"><span class="label">[FC]</span></a> "Sonnet V. is generally taken to be descriptive of Cockley Beck. Here,
as we emerge from Wrynose Bottom, the first <em>trees</em> meet the eye after a full
two miles of monotony and stones, and here, too, is the first <em>cottage</em> where
the 'ruddy children' of another generation 'sport through the summer day.'
The cottage itself is not indeed surrounded at the present time by 'sheltering
pines'&mdash;that is a feature which applies better to another cottage half a mile
lower down the stream&mdash;but they may, of course, have disappeared since
Wordsworth's day; indeed, I was informed in 1885, by a woman then living
in the cottage, that many which formerly stood behind the cottage had been
felled within her own memory. A very accurate picture of the cottage and
neighbouring bridge is given in Harry Goodwin's <cite>Through the Wordsworth
Country</cite>. There is also a sketch at page 15 of Thorne's <cite>Rambles by
Rivers</cite>." (Herbert Rix.)</p>

<p>"Wordsworth would probably have in his mind most of the few cots and
farms in the upper reaches of the Duddon Vale as he wrote his Sonnet v.
Half-a-mile south, the 'craggy mound' of the castle-like rock would rear out
of mid-valley impressively enough. The larches that now sway and whisper
about Cockley Beck, or on the little mound to the east of it, would then only
be tiny trees. The birches may have risen in 'silver colonnade,' but now
a few ashes, a few poplars, a few alders are the only trees near. Still, for
the most part, the term 'unfruitful solitudes' characterises the spot; and as
the traveller at Cockley Beck looks north and east, these solitudes become
impressively solemn from the dark desolation of craggy fell-side and utter
treelessness." (H. D. Rawnsley.)</p></div>

<p>These two lines are in a great measure taken from <cite>The Beauties of
Spring, a Juvenile Poem</cite>, by the Rev. Joseph Sympson, author of <cite>The
Vision of Alfred</cite>, etc. He was a native of Cumberland, and was educated
in the vale of Grasmere, and at Hawkshead school: his poems are little
known, but they contain passages of splendid description; and the versification
of his <cite>Vision of Alfred</cite> is harmonious and animated. The present
severe season,<a name="FNanchor_438_600" id="FNanchor_438_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_600" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> with its amusements, reminds me of some lines which I will
transcribe as a favourable specimen. In describing the motions of the
Sylphs, that constitute the strange machinery of his <cite>Vision of Alfred</cite>, he
uses the following illustrative simile:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="i0">On Bothnia's gulf with glassy ice o'erspread,</div>
  <div class="i0">Where the lone native, as he homeward glides,</div>
  <div class="i0">On polish'd sandals o'er the imprisoned tides,</div>
  <div class="i0">And still the balance of his frame preserves,</div>
  <div class="i0">Wheel'd on alternate foot in lengthening curves,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sees at a glance, above him and below,</div>
  <div class="i0">Two rival heav'ns with equal splendour glow.</div>

<p>He was a man of ardent feeling, and his faculties of mind, particularly his

strawberry, speedwell, and thyme, mentioned in the sonnet, but sundry other
flowers, such as the Spearwort, Milkwort, Small Bedstraw, <cite>Euphrasia
officinalis</cite>, and <cite>Potentilla tormentilla</cite>, but this and the following Sonnet
were perhaps inspired by the beauty of the flowery meadows just below
Cockley Beck." (Herbert Rix.)</p>

<p>"Wordsworth, from his Sonnet <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, would seem to have been describing
the Duddon in April; and though by some misnomer 'the little speedwell's
darling blue' has by him been called the 'trembling eyebright,' to-day in
July 1884&mdash;though the time of the singing of birds who 'warble to their
paramours' is over and gone&mdash;one can see by Duddon-side these 'old remains
of hawthorn bowers.'</p>

<p>But I shall never forget the beauty or the size of the golden feathery spikes
of sweet-scented Gallium (lady's bed straw), or the wonderful odour of the
self-heal, and the glory of the harebells, as I saw them carpeting the
meadows near Cockley Beck, this July day, 1884; and, as I plucked the very
faintly scented euphrasia (or eyebright), I wondered much which were the
spring-flowers Wordsworth had in his mind that by their breath invited no
caress. Would it be the buttercup, the daisy, or which? He must have had
some definite flower&mdash;scentless, but not less beautiful&mdash;in his eye as he wrote

this part of the valley which could be so described. A footpath which
passes through the farmyard of Black Hall runs alongside this ghyll and
joins the Duddon Valley with the Whitehaven Road. The 'blue streamlet'
would then perhaps be the little tributary which flows down the length of
the ghyll over a slaty bed to join the Duddon below; or perhaps Wordsworth
was mentally addressing the Duddon itself, though from the interior
of the ghyll he would not be able to see it.</p>

<p>The alternative view is that by the 'dark dell' no particular spot is
indicated but the whole of the upper valley of the Duddon, which is of a
savage and forbidding aspect, and quite of a character to have inspired the
sonnet. It is almost treeless, and the ground on either side of the stream
is covered with bracken and loose blocks of slate, while the fells rise steeply
on either hand, and are capped by naked crags.</p>

<p>As to the epithet '<em>blue</em>' (line 10), the cerulean colour of the Duddon is
one of its most exquisite characteristics, and is due, as Wordsworth has
himself<a name="FNanchor_FH_604" id="FNanchor_FH_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_FH_604" class="fnanchor">[FH]</a> explained, to the hue of the rocks and gravel seen through the
'perfectly pellucid' water." (Herbert Rix.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This sonnet puzzles me from the use of the words <em>dark dell</em>. I could
find nothing at all hereabout that could possibly be described so, until I
looked back at the rain-black solitudes north of Cockley Beck, and imagined
the poet using the word dark in the sense of mysterious, when I can imagine
he would have been helped to this thought of hideous usages, and rites
accursed, by the large Druid-like-looking boulders, and the mounds of
burial, suggested by the moraine-heaps in the neighbourhood. But I think
the '<em>blue Streamlet</em>' must have been suggested by the light blue grey colour
of the slate pebbles over which Duddon slides so easily here." (H. D.
Rawnsley.)</p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_FI_605" id="Footnote_FI_605"></a><a href="#FNanchor_FI_605"><span class="label">[FI]</span></a> "There are four sets of stepping-stones across the Duddon. The first
set is between Cockley Beck and Birks Brig, opposite to a farmhouse called
Dale Head; the second set, called by the natives of the district the 'Fiddle
Steps,' is in a deep hollow between Birks Brig and Seathwaite, at a point
where the footpath to Eskdale crosses the Duddon; the third is opposite
Seathwaite, and the fourth just above Ulpha.</p>

<p>Of these, the second and fourth may, I think, be disregarded. The
question lies between the first and third, which we will call respectively the
<em>upper</em> and the <em>lower</em> stones.</p>

<p>James Thorne has fixed upon the upper stones as those of Wordsworth's
two sonnets, and has given a picture of them. His woodcut is very rude,
but is sufficiently defined by the number of the stones, the gate on the
right, and the distant cottage on the left. Mrs. Lynn Linton, too, in her
<cite>Lake Country</cite> (London, 1864, p. 251), claims the honour for the same set,
and has given (p. 252), a very pretty picture of them. Miss Martineau, on
the contrary, in her <cite>Survey of the Lake District</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_441_607" id="FNanchor_441_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_607" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> appears to regard the
stones opposite Seathwaite as <em>the</em> stones; and the Rev. F. A. Malleson, in
his article on 'Wordsworth and the Duddon,'<a name="FNanchor_442_608" id="FNanchor_442_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_608" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> takes the same view. This
is the view which local tradition favours, for any inhabitant of Seathwaite
or Ulpha, if asked for 'Wordsworth's Stones,' would at once direct the
stranger to the <em>lower</em> stones.</p>

<p>There is something to be said for each of these opinions. The upper
stones fit in with the order of the sonnets, coming after the sonnet about
Cockley Beck, and before the sonnets about the Faëry Chasm, Seathwaite
Chapel, and Ulpha Kirk. Moreover, the emphasis of the earlier sonnets in
general, and of the opening lines of Sonnet IX. in particular, is on the growth
of the 'struggling rill'&mdash;a thought which would be rather out of place if it
came later in the series.</p>

<p>On the other hand the 'zone chosen for ornament,' and the 'studied
symmetry' are more applicable to the lower than to the upper stones;
they are of a bluish tint, are set at equal distances, and form a slight curve
down stream, looking to a fanciful eye as though they were bending with
the current. They are now (1894) disused, having been abandoned, on
account of the frequent floods, in favour of a foot-bridge recently erected a
little higher up the stream; and already the path to the stepping-stones
is overgrown and nearly obliterated.

If the sonnets are taken to refer to the lower stones 'yon high rock'
would probably mean Wallabarrow; if to the upper stones, they would
doubtless mean Castle How, a solitary and noticeable rock." (Herbert Rix.)</p>

<p class="p5">"One cannot but believe that Wordsworth, as he wrote Sonnets <span class="smcap">IX.</span>, <span class="smcap">X.</span>,
had in his mind the third series of stepping-stones opposite Seathwaite, and
under Wallabarrow Crag.</p>

<p>None of the others are fitly described as</p>

<div class="line">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">a zone chosen for ornament.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Is it not possible that the word 'struggling,' as applied to rill,&mdash;when
viewed in connection with the words 'without restraint,' in line 8 of Sonnet
<span class="smcap">IX.</span>&mdash;points with great definiteness to the localising of the Sonnet at these
Seathwaite stones?</p>

<p>Certainly the stream as it has descended through the 'deep chasm' of
Sonnet <span class="smcap">XV.</span> between the Pen and Wallabarrow, is well described as having
grown after a struggle into a brook of loud and stately march at this point.
There are no likelier spots for the children to have put</p>

<p>than here, for there are several houses and farms on the wayside, whose
younger inmates would have come down to these stepping-stones, in order
to get to the village school, that 'Wonderful Walker' kept with so much
honour at Seathwaite in olden time." (H. D. Rawnsley.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_FJ_609" id="Footnote_FJ_609"></a><a href="#FNanchor_FJ_609"><span class="label">[FJ]</span></a> "Adopting the view that Sonnets <span class="smcap">IX.</span> and <span class="smcap">X.</span> refer to the stepping-stones
at Dale Head, the position of the 'Faëry Chasm,' which has often caused
perplexity, becomes clear. It must be looked for not below but considerably
above Seathwaite, and is, in fact, the very next striking feature that occurs
after the stepping-stones at Dale Head are passed. It is, I believe, the
rocky gorge which is crossed by Birks Brig.</p>

<p>The stream is here precipitated down a series of falls, and at the same
time is forced into a much narrower channel than it has hitherto occupied.
In its downward course it is thrust from side to side in a series of rebounds,
the effect being that the flood is churned into a mass of foam, while the
rocks between which it is driven are scooped and chiselled into the most
fantastic shapes&mdash;basins and niches, caverns and arches, and pillars with
an odd spiral twist. Anything of a more elfin character could hardly be
conceived.</p>

<p>The turbulence of the water as it descends towards the bridge is very
well expressed in the charming little sketch given at page 245 of Mrs. Lynn
Linton's <cite>Lake Country</cite>, but the cleft itself is not there represented. Of
that, or a part of it, an illustration has been given by Mr. Chattock in his
etchings of the River Duddon published in 1884 by the Fine Art Society.</p>

<p>Neither Mr. Chattock nor Mrs. Lynn Linton has, however, identified
the spot with the 'Faëry Chasm.' Mr. Chattock associates it with Sonnet
<span class="smcap">XX.</span>, though the imagery of that sonnet must, as he himself confesses, have
been 'inspired by some scene farther down the river,' while Mrs. Lynn
Linton (p. 251) finds the 'Faëry Chasm' at Gowdrel Crag. This latter
view, which is, apparently, that adopted also by Canon Rawnsley, is a very
possible alternative, and is favoured by the fact that the bed of the stream
is at that point strewn with blocks of sky-blue stone. In that case Sonnets
<span class="smcap">XI.</span> and <span class="smcap">XII.</span> refer to the same chasm. Mr. Goodwin in <cite>Through the
Wordsworth Country</cite>, illustrates a note on the Faëry Chasm by a picture
of the chasm at Wallabarrow, and of all the 'clefts' this best fits with the
epithet 'sunless'; but is it not too vast for fairy scenes?</p>

<p>I could not learn that any faëry tradition was associated with either
place." (Herbert Rix.)</p>

<p class="p5">"I cannot rest satisfied that the Faëry Chasm of Sonnet <span class="smcap">XI.</span> is to be
looked for at Birks Brig. No sky-blue stone, above water or below, can
be pointed out&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_FL_613" id="Footnote_FL_613"></a><a href="#FNanchor_FL_613"><span class="label">[FL]</span></a> "In determining the spot to which this sonnet belongs two conditions
have to be satisfied. In the first place, Seathwaite must be seen from it;
and, in the second, there must be an open prospect of fields. Now, from
Cockley Beck to Ulpha there is no single spot upon the road satisfying these
two conditions. Unless the line of the river is entirely abandoned, and some
point of view high up on the fells is taken, there is, I believe, only one station
in all the valley which supplies them, and that is the summit of a rock called
in maps and guide-books 'Pen Crag,' but which the dalesmen always call
simply '<em>The Pen</em>' (not to be confounded with the mountain of that name
lower down the valley on the west). There is an additional reason for regarding
the Pen as the station whence Wordsworth viewed his 'open prospect,'
namely, that the point from which the ascent of the crag is most conveniently
made is identical with the point where the Duddon makes his second plunge
into a rocky abyss, which plunge is signalised in the very next sonnet (<span class="smcap">XIV.</span>).
Thus, at the very spot where the poet is enabled to gain a view of 'the
haunts of men,' 'some awful Spirit' impels the torrent 'utterly to desert'
those haunts, and to make a second plunge into the wilderness. An increased
significance is thus given to each of the sonnets (<span class="smcap">XIII.</span> and <span class="smcap">XIV.</span>) by the
juxtaposition of the localities which they describe.</p>

<p>I should explain, in connection with this, that the Pen stands in the centre
of the valley, a prominent and inviting look-out, and that the easy slope, by
which it is on one side ascended, rises from the high-road, so that anybody
who cares for views at all&mdash;and Wordsworth above all people&mdash;would not
think of passing by without climbing to such an obvious point of vantage.</p>

<p>The 'one small hamlet' (line 2) is Seathwaite, which lies just below the
Pen.</p>

<p>The 'barn and byre' (line 3) must have belonged to Newfield, the only
farmhouse in the foreground.</p>

<p>The 'spouting mill' (line 3) is now a ruin. In Wordsworth's time it was
in full work. Later (in the autumn of 1842), when it was visited by James
Thorne, the wheel was broken, the machinery decaying, and the roof partly
fallen in. At the present time, wheel, machinery, and roof have totally
disappeared, and there is nothing to indicate that it ever was a mill. It was
only by inquiring of the older inhabitants that I learnt these ruined walls
standing by the Beck represent that 'mill for spinning yarn,' of which
Wordsworth says that it calls to mind 'the momentous changes wrought by
such inventions in the frame of society.' The ruin stands on the Tarn Beck,
a few yards below Seathwaite Chapel, and on the other side of the stream.</p>

<p>The last three lines of the sonnet,</p>

<div class="line">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">While the warm hearth exalts the mantling ale, etc.,</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>are probably an allusion to the Inn which, in Wordsworth's time, was to be
found here. This is now a farmstead. It is called Newfield, and is just
below Seathwaite Chapel. In Wordsworth's day it was inn and farm
combined.</p>

<p>Mr. Malleson, in the article quoted above, appears (p. 576) to regard the
green slope ascending towards Seathwaite Tarn, which opens on the left
about a mile before the traveller reaches Seathwaite Chapel, as the 'Open
Prospect'; but, though the fields here are certainly 'sprinkled o'er with
dwellings,' the juxtaposition of the 'hamlet,' the 'barn and byre,' and the
'spouting mill' is wanting, and the allusion to the inn loses its point."
(Herbert Rix.)</p>

<p class="p5">"It may be of interest to know that still the Newfield farm (in Wordsworth's
time farm and inn combined) keeps up the well-deserved description
of the poet. It is still 'a generous household.' When the yeoman, who
was the last innkeeper and farmer combined, was on his death-bed, he
enjoined those to whom Newfield passed to remember that 'though the
license was to drop, and it was to become a private house, yet no stranger
in the valley who requested a night's lodging was ever to be refused,' and
the generous household are proud to keep up the tradition of hospitality."

<p><a name="Footnote_FO_616" id="Footnote_FO_616"></a><a href="#FNanchor_FO_616"><span class="label">[FO]</span></a> "The 'deep chasm' of this sonnet is identical with the 'passage cleft
through the wilderness' of Sonnet <span class="smcap">XIV</span>. It lies between the Pen on the left
hand, and Wallabarrow Crag on the right. As to the <em>niche</em>, which forms
the subject of the sonnet, it cannot now be identified. There are, of course,
plenty of such niches in the crags which tower above the Duddon just here,
but none more striking than the rest. From the fact that it was 'free from
shrubs and mosses grey,' one may perhaps infer that it was a place in the
cliff from which a mass of rock had recently fallen. The bed of the stream
just here is a chaos of such masses of rock, some of them being of enormous
size.</p>

<p>Mr. Chattock identifies the 'chasm' with that at Gowdrel, higher up
the river&mdash;a view which, besides breaking the order of the sonnets, would
seem to be excluded by Wordsworth's note on Sonnets <span class="smcap">XVII.</span> and <span class="smcap">XVIII.</span>,
wherein he expressly states that the scenery 'which gave occasion to the
sonnets <em>from the 14th to the 20th inclusive</em>,' lies about Seathwaite. Mr.
Chattock's remark that 'the rocks are columnar in character,' so that the
fall of a fragment readily gives rise to the appearance of an elongated
'niche,' is worthy of note. It would probably apply to either chasm."

<p>"I cannot quit this first link (the finding of a piece of gold) of the
mountains of Encaramada without recalling to mind a fact that was not
unknown to Father Gili, and which was often mentioned to me during our
abode in the Missions of the Orinoco. The natives of those countries have
retained the belief that, 'at the time of the great waters, when their fathers
were forced to have recourse to boats to escape the general inundation, the
waves of the sea beat against the rocks of Encaramada.' This belief is not
confined to one nation singly, the Tamanacs; it makes part of a system of
historical tradition, of which we find scattered notions among the Maypures
of the great cataracts, among the Indians of the Rio Erevato, which runs
into the Caura, and among almost all the tribes of the Upper Orinoco.
When the Tamanacs are asked how the human race survived this great
Deluge, the 'age of water' of the Mexicans, they say, 'a man and a woman
saved themselves on a high mountain, called Tamanacu, situated on the
banks of the Asiveru, and casting behind them, over their heads, the fruits
of the Mauritia palm-tree, they saw the seeds contained in those fruits
produce men and women, who re-peopled the earth.' Thus we find in all its
simplicity, among nations now in a savage state, a tradition which the
Greeks embellished with all the charms of imagination! A few leagues
from Encaramada, a rock, called <em>Tepu-mereme</em>, or 'the painted rock,' rises
in the midst of the Savannah. Upon it are traced representations of animals,
and symbolic figures resembling those we saw in going down the Orinoco, at
a small distance below Encaramada, near the town Caycara. Similar rocks
in Africa are called by travellers <em>fetish-stones</em>. I shall not make use of this
term, because fetishism does not prevail among the natives of the Orinoco;
and the figures of stars, of the sun, of tigers, and of crocodiles, which we
found traced upon the rocks in spots now uninhabited, appeared to me in no
way to denote the objects of worship of those nations. Between the banks
of the Cassiquiare and the Orinoco, between Encaramada, the Capuchino,
and Caycara, these hieroglyphic figures are often seen at great heights, on
rocky cliffs which could be accessible only by constructing very lofty
scaffolds. When the natives are asked how those figures could have been
sculptured, they answer with a smile, as if relating a fact of which only a
white man could be ignorant, that 'at the period of the great waters, their
fathers went to that height in boats.'" Extract from <cite>Humboldt's Travels</cite>,
vol. ii. chap. iv. pp. 182-3 (Bohn's Edition.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>"The weathering of the volcanic ash of the Pen and the cliff of
Wallabarrow opposite would naturally have suggested this sonnet.
Evidence of ice-marking and glacier-action are not wanting in the
neighbourhood." (H. D. Rawnsley.)</p></div>

applied to the district on the east bank of the Duddon from Broughton up
to Ulpha Bridge, and extending thence parallel to Seathwaite, from which
it is divided by fells. Guide-books sometimes apply the term to the whole
valley of the Duddon, but this is entirely wrong; the term is never applied
by the inhabitants to the upper or confined part of the valley, and is
correctly used by Wordsworth to indicate the open plain of the lower stream.</p>

<p><em>Hall Dunnerdale</em>, sometimes shortened into <em>Dunnerdale</em>, is a hamlet on
the high-road between Seathwaite and Ulpha. From a bridge just below
this hamlet the characteristics of the stream at this part of its course as
described in Sonnet <span class="smcap">XX.</span> may best be noted. The banks are thickly wooded
with oak, ash, beech, alder, sycamore, and larch; the hills are lower and
greener than the fells farther up the valley, and for the moment we might
almost think we had been transported to the banks of the Wey, and were
looking upon a Surrey landscape. The water above and below the bridge
is comparatively still. But this, as the sonnet says, is not to last long,&mdash;'a
rough course remains, rough as the past.' Before we reach Ulpha

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;I am not surprised at our topographical divisions giving a
stranger difficulty. They belong to the cross kind. Thus, Dunnerdale (as
it is now here usually spelled) forms an integral part of the civil division,
or township, of Dunnerdale and Seathwaite, whilst ecclesiastically it is
attached, not to Seathwaite, but to the ecclesiastical parish or district of
Broughton-in-Furness; Seathwaite, Broughton-in-Furness, and Woodland
(now all separate benefices), being so many outlying parts of the ancient
ecclesiastical and civil parish of Kirkby-Ireleth. Dunnerdale itself is the
name given to the district which lies on the east or Lancashire bank of the
Duddon, from a point a few yards south of Ulpha bridge till it meets the
boundary of Broughton proper, or the right bank of the Lickle, a small
tributary of the Duddon, the main portion of it being enclosed in a little
valley parallel to that of the Duddon. The fells bounding it do, on the
more northern part, form a line of division from Seathwaite....</p>

old inhabitants of the place if they had ever heard such a story, but it
was quite new to them.</p>

<p>The scene of the tragedy is not, however, very difficult to identify.
There are very few 'hidden pools' in this part of the stream; it is mostly
a shallow, brawling brook. I have carefully tracked the stream from Donnerdale
Bridge to Ulpha Bridge, and can only find two places which at all
answer to the description given in the sonnet. One of these is opposite the
'Traveller's Rest' inn, the other, is a little higher up. This latter is a
deep and placid pool, situated half way down a curious corridor, known as
'Long Dub,' where the stream flows for some distance in a straight line
between walls of rough mountain slate, the strata having been tilted almost
at right angles to their natural position. Here a little rill tumbles into the
Duddon by a miniature cascade, and the pool is sheltered and darkened by oak
and beech&mdash;a not unlikely spot to have inspired the sonnet." (Herbert Rix.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_GD_648" id="Footnote_GD_648"></a><a href="#FNanchor_GD_648"><span class="label">[GD]</span></a> Sonnet No. <span class="smcap">XXVII.</span> having been first published in <cite>The Waggoner</cite> and
other poems (1819), was not reprinted in either of the editions of 1820. It
was "taken from a tradition belonging to Rydal Hall," as is explained in
the Fenwick note, p. 226.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>"Sonnets <span class="smcap">XXIV.</span> to <span class="smcap">XXVII.</span> appear to have been written in one spot,&mdash;some
'Nook&mdash;with woodbine hung and straggling weed.' If the poet has
strictly retained in the sonnets the order in which the places lie upon the
river-bank, this nook must be within a stone's throw of the pool mentioned
in the preceding note, for the scenes of Sonnets <span class="smcap">XXIX.</span> and <span class="smcap">XXXI.</span> are
close at hand. But, though there are plenty of such 'grottos' or
'arbours' here, some difficulty arises from the fact that the Old Hall and
ruined keep cannot be seen from this part of the stream, nor, indeed, can
they be seen from Ulpha itself, nor from any part of the high road. The
height upon which the ruin stands is certainly a prominent feature in the
landscape, but the ruin itself is completely hidden by a shoulder of the hill,
neither can the hill by any stretch of the imagination be called a 'cliff.'</p>

<p>The only point of view from which the castle appears to stand upon a
'cliff' is reached by a footpath near some copper works, about half way up
Holehouse Ghyll. Here you see the ruin at the end (or rather <em>bend</em>) of the
Ghyll high above your head, the sides of the ravine rising steeply to
its walls. Holehouse Ghyll is thickly wooded, so that this may very possibly
be the poet's 'dim retreat,' the chief objection being that the Ghyll lies
below Ulpha Kirk, and that the order of the sonnets would thus be broken.</p>

<p>But wherever the poet's 'nook' may have been, there can be little doubt
that the fragment of masonry near the farmhouse called 'The Old Hall,'
represents the 'embattled house' of Sonnet <span class="smcap">XXVII.</span>, for Broughton
Tower, the only other fortified house in the valley, is still some miles away,
and the rising ground upon which it stands is no cliff, but a mere undulation
in the centre of the nether valley. Of the Castle at the head of Holehouse
Ghyll there is little enough remaining&mdash;less, even, than in Wordsworth's day,
for a woman living in a cottage close by it assured me that she could remember
when there was much more of it standing than at the present time.
The cause to which she assigned its rapid disappearance was not, however,
the same as that assigned in the first two lines of the sonnet. According to
her, natural decay had less to do with it than the destructive hands of the
dalesmen, who pulled the stones down to mend the fell-walls with. A
native of Ulpha added that a new barn was built for the adjoining farmhouse
some little time since, and that a great part of the materials doubtless
came from the old ruin.</p>

<p>A ragged piece of wall three to four feet in thickness, with three small
square windows splayed inwards, and a fireplace about 6 feet long by 12 feet
high, with a wide chimney, is all that now remains <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in situ</i>, of this seat of the
Lords of Ulpha.</p>

<p>As to the ghostly tradition embodied in Sonnet <span class="smcap">XXVII</span>. Wordsworth
himself has explained (see the Fenwick note) that it was borrowed from
Rydal Hall. But the 'Old Hall' has a weird tradition of its own, for in the
bottom of the Ghyll beneath the Castle walls, there is a pool, called 'The Lady's
Dub,' where in old times a lady was killed by one of the numerous wolves
which formerly infested the region. This is, in fact, the origin, according to
some of the inhabitants, of the name 'Ulpha' ('Wolfa'). But a more likely
derivation seems to be from Ulf, the father of Ketell, the father of Bennett,
the father of Allan. Ketell lived in Henry III.'s reign, and Bennett in King
John's, and to their ancestor Ulf the lordship of 'Ulphay' was granted.<a name="FNanchor_462_649" id="FNanchor_462_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_649" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Chattock has given an excellent etching of the ruin.</p>

<p>If the 'Nook' of Sonnet <span class="smcap">XXIV.</span> be in Holehouse Ghyll, and the 'embattled
House' of Sonnet <span class="smcap">XXVII.</span> be The Old Hall seen from that spot, then Sonnet
<span class="smcap">XXVI.</span> should specially refer to the stream which rushes down that Ghyll.
'Through tangled woods' well suits this stream; and even the 'sullen reservoirs'
are not wanting if the two 'dubs' at the upper end of the Ghyll are taken
into account." (Herbert Rix.)</p></div>

Bridge, near a farmhouse called New Close is a small enclosure, 44 feet
square, with two old fir-trees and a quantity of laurels, which there can be
little doubt is the scene of Sonnet <span class="smcap">XXIX</span>.</p>

<p>The enclosure, known to the country people as the Sepulchre, is an old
burial-place of the Society of Friends, none having been interred there since
1755, when a Friend from Birker, a small hamlet about four miles distant,
was buried.<a name="FNanchor_464_652" id="FNanchor_464_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_652" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

</div>

<p>the earth is 'blank,' because there is not a single tombstone, and the graves
are (at any rate at the present time) most literally 'neglected and forlorn,'
for the place is a tangle of rank grass and untrimmed bushes.</p>

<p>About the year 1842 it was planted with fruit-trees, but when Wordsworth
saw it, it probably presented much the same appearance as at
present.</p>

  <div class="i0">No record tells of lance opposed to lance, etc.,</div>
 </div>

</div>

<p>and indeed the whole sonnet obtains a new significance from the
association of the spot which it describes with the <em>men of peace</em>."
(Herbert Rix.)</p>

<p>"There are few more touching scenes in the Duddon Valley than the little
lonely hillside burial-place of the early Friends, spoken of in Sonnet
<span class="smcap">XXIX</span>. All round the inside of the rude wall enclosure are still to be
seen the stone seats used by the followers of Fox, who were forbidden to
hold their meetings under any lower roof than the canopy of Heaven. The
Scotch firs have grown into stately shade since the Quakers sat in
silent meditation high up, lifted above the life of the valley and the
noise of Duddon and the tributary stream just opposite. But though the
Friends lie here in unvisited graves, the earth is neither blank nor
forlorn. Laurels glisten above their rest, and the <em>Spiræa salicifolia</em>
waves its light wands of flower above their sleep, all evidences of care
for the heroes of a cause that is not dead yet." (H. D. Rawnsley.)</p></div>

Duddon. From time immemorial its walls have been whitewashed, so that
on a sunny day it <em>literally</em> 'shines' from its exalted position. It is best seen
from the hay-fields on the left bank just above Ulpha Bridge. These fields
lie low, and the church perched on its rock seems lifted higher than from any
other point of view.</p>

<p>When I visited Ulpha in the summer of 1882 I found the carpenters at
work restoring it, and since then a new belfry has been erected, and the
tiny white porch has been replaced by a larger one of wood. But I saw it
in 1881, when the interior, as well as the exterior, still kept the appearance
which it wore in Wordsworth's day. The pulpit (with sounding-board)
was in the middle of one side, and to the right hand thereof were a magnificent
lion-and-unicorn, and 'G. III. R.' The font was up against the wall,
with a ladder hung above it. There was no vestry; the surplice was kept
in a cupboard near the door, and the clergyman donned and doffed it
behind a screen which only partially hid him. The pews were square and
high, and the people sat all round them, with their backs to all four points
of the compass; but when the hymn was sung they all turned with their
backs to the altar and their faces to the choir." (Herbert Rix.)</p>

<p class="p3">"The last line of this sonnet is a good instance of Wordsworth's very
close observation. The little churchyard has lately had an addition made
to it. Any one going into the new part of the churchyard will be less able to
understand the accuracy of the last line." (H. D. Rawnsley.)</p></div>

the doubtful exceptions of the sonnets on the 'Stepping-Stones' and the
'Resting-Place,' each one falls naturally into its order. The Birth-place on
Wrynose, the 'sinuous lapse' along the pass, the Descent into the Valley,
the Cottage at Cockley Beck, Gowdrel Crag, Wallabarrow and the Pen,
Seathwaite Chapel, the Tributary Stream, Long Dub, the Sepulchre at
New Close, Ulpha Kirk, Duddon Sands&mdash;to all these places there are clear

<p>The allusion to the Greek poet will be obvious to the classical reader.&mdash;W. W.

</div>

<p>has been suggested by the well-known lines in the Ἐπιτάφιον Βίωνος, by the

</div>

<p>You will see that Wordsworth has <em>translated</em> the Greek verse which I
underline ('brave' representing μεγάλοι). The 'mallows,' 'parsley,' 'anise'
of the Greek poet's garden&mdash;which are to live again&mdash;are represented by
Wordsworth's stream which 'shall for ever glide.'</p>

<p>One might <em>contrast</em> the lines in the <cite>Christian Year</cite> about the autumn
leaves:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>No one believes, or is desired to believe, that these Poems
were actually composed within such limits of time; nor was
there any reason why a prose statement should acquaint the
Reader with the plain fact, to the disturbance of poetic credibility.
But, in the present case, I am compelled to mention, that the
above series of Sonnets was the growth of many years;&mdash;the
one which stands the 14th was the first produced; and others
were added upon occasional visits to the Stream, or as recollections
of the scenes upon its banks awakened a wish to describe
them. In this manner I had proceeded insensibly, without
perceiving that I was trespassing upon ground preoccupied, at
least as far as intention went, by Mr. Coleridge; who, more
than twenty years ago, used to speak of writing a rural Poem,
to be entitled "The Brook," of which he has given a sketch in
a recent publication. But a particular subject, cannot, I think,
much interfere with a general one; and I have been further
kept from encroaching upon any right Mr. C. may still wish to
exercise, by the restriction which the frame of the Sonnet
imposed upon me, narrowing unavoidably the range of thought,
and precluding, though not without its advantages, many graces
to which a freer movement of verse would naturally have led.</p>

<p>May I not venture, then, to hope, that instead of being a
hindrance, by anticipation of any part of the subject, these
Sonnets may remind Mr. Coleridge of his own more comprehensive
design, and induce him to fulfil it?<a name="FNanchor_GO_664" id="FNanchor_GO_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_GO_664" class="fnanchor">[GO]</a>&mdash;&mdash;There is a
sympathy in streams,&mdash;"one calleth to another"; and, I would
gladly believe, that "The Brook" will, ere long, murmur in
concert with "The Duddon." But, asking pardon for this
fancy, I need not scruple to say, that those verses must indeed
be ill-fated which can enter upon such pleasant walks of nature,
without receiving and giving inspiration. The power of waters
over the minds of Poets has been acknowledged from the earliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
ages;&mdash;through the "Flumina amem sylvasque inglorius" of
Virgil,<a name="FNanchor_GP_665" id="FNanchor_GP_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_GP_665" class="fnanchor">[GP]</a> down to the sublime apostrophe to the great rivers of
the earth, by Armstrong,<a name="FNanchor_GQ_666" id="FNanchor_GQ_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_GQ_666" class="fnanchor">[GQ]</a> and the simple ejaculation of Burns,<a name="FNanchor_GR_667" id="FNanchor_GR_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_GR_667" class="fnanchor">[GR]</a>
(chosen, if I recollect right, by Mr. Coleridge, as a motto for
his embryo "Brook"),</p>

<p>As an illustration of the extraordinary freaks of contemporary
criticism&mdash;freaks which still tarnish much that issues from the
press&mdash;an estimate of those Duddon Sonnets, which appeared
in <cite>The Monthly Review</cite> in 1820, may be referred to. All that
posterity now admires in this exquisite series of descriptive
poems is decried; and those passages which posterity regards
as blemishes, are held up to admiration; <em>e.g.</em> the lines with
which the tenth sonnet, in "The Stepping-Stones," concludes,
which are so frigid and affected, were hailed as "a complete
return into the regions of antiquity," and as a sign that "Mr.
Wordsworth is certainly improving"! They are the very feeble
lines:&mdash;</p>

<h3>NOTE TO SONNETS XVII AND XVIII</h3>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Eagle</span> requires a large domain for its support; but several
pairs, not many years ago, were constantly resident in this
country, building their nests in the steeps of Borrowdale, Wastdale,
Ennerdale, and on the eastern side of Helvellyn. Often have
I heard anglers speak of the grandeur of their appearance, as they
hovered over Red Tarn, in one of the coves of this mountain.
The bird frequently returns, but is always destroyed. Not long
since one visited Rydal Lake, and remained some hours near its
banks; the consternation which it occasioned among the different
species of fowl, particularly the herons, was expressed by
loud screams. The horse also is naturally afraid of the eagle.&mdash;There
were several Roman stations among these mountains;
the most considerable seems to have been in a meadow at the
head of Windermere, established, undoubtedly, as a check over
the passes of Kirkstone, Dunmail-raise, and of Hardknot and
Wrynose. On the margin of Rydal Lake, a coin of Trajan was
discovered very lately.&mdash;The <span class="smcap">Roman Fort</span> here alluded to,
called by the country people "<cite>Hardknot Castle</cite>," is most impressively
situated half-way down the hill on the right of the road
that descends from Hardknot into Eskdale. It has escaped the
notice of most antiquarians, and is but slightly mentioned by
Lysons.&mdash;The <span class="smcap">Druidical Circle</span> is about half a mile to the left
of the road ascending Stone-side from the vale of Duddon: the
country people call it "<cite>Sunken Church</cite>."</p>

<p>The reader who may have been interested in the foregoing
Sonnets (which together may be considered as a Poem) will
not be displeased to find in this place a prose account of the
Duddon, extracted from Green's comprehensive <cite>Guide to the
Lakes</cite>, lately published. "The road leading from Coniston to
Broughton is over high ground, and commands a view of the
river Duddon; which at high water is a grand sight, having
the beautiful and fertile lands of Lancashire and Cumberland
stretching each way from its margin. In this extensive view,
the face of nature is displayed in a wonderful variety of hill and
dale; wooded grounds and buildings; amongst the latter,
Broughton Tower, seated on the crown of a hill, rising elegantly
from the valley, is an object of extraordinary interest. Fertility
on each side is gradually diminished, and lost in the superior
heights of Blackcomb, in Cumberland, and the high lands
between Kirkby and Ulverstone.</p>

<p>"The road from Broughton to Seathwaite is on the banks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
the Duddon, and on its Lancashire side it is of various elevations.
The river is an amusing companion, one while brawling
and tumbling over rocky precipices, until the agitated water
becomes again calm by arriving at a smoother and less precipitous
bed, but its course is soon again ruffled, and the current
thrown into every variety of form which the rocky channel of a
river can give to water." (<cite>Vide</cite> Green's <cite>Guide to the Lakes</cite>,
vol. i. pp. 98-100.)</p>

<p>After all, the traveller would be most gratified who should
approach this beautiful Stream, neither at its source, as is done
in the Sonnets, nor from its termination; but from Coniston
over Walna Scar; first descending into a little circular valley, a
collateral compartment of the long winding vale through which
flows the Duddon. This recess, towards the close of September,
when the after-grass of the meadows is still of a fresh green,
with the leaves of many of the trees faded, but perhaps none
fallen, is truly enchanting. At a point elevated enough to
show the various objects in the valley, and not so high as to
diminish their importance, the stranger will instinctively halt. On
the foreground, a little below the most favourable station, a rude
foot-bridge is thrown over the bed of the noisy brook, foaming
by the wayside. Russet and craggy hills, of bold and varied
outline, surround the level valley which is besprinkled with
grey rocks plumed with birch trees. A few homesteads are
interspersed in some places, peeping out from among the rocks
like hermitages, whose site has been chosen for the benefit of
sunshine as well as shelter; in other instances, the dwelling-house,
barn, and byre, compose together a cruciform structure,
which, with its embowering trees and the ivy clothing part of
the walls and roof, like a fleece, call to mind the remains of an
ancient abbey. Time, in most cases, and nature every where,
have given a sanctity to the humble works of man, that are
scattered over this peaceful retirement. Hence a harmony of
tone and colour, a consummation and perfection of beauty,
which would have been marred had aim or purpose interfered
with the course of convenience, utility, or necessity. This
unvitiated region stands in no need of the veil of twilight to
soften or disguise its features. As it glistens in the morning
sunshine, it would fill the spectator's heart with gladsomeness.
Looking from our chosen station, he would feel an impatience
to rove among its pathways, to be greeted by the milkmaid, to
wander from house to house, exchanging "good-morrows" as
he passed the open doors; but, at evening, when the sun is set,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
and a pearly light gleams from the western quarter of the sky,
with an answering light from the smooth surface of the meadows;
when the trees are dusky, but each kind still distinguishable;
when the cool air has condensed the blue smoke rising from the
cottage-chimneys; when the dark mossy stones seem to sleep
in the bed of the foaming Brook; <em>then</em>, he would be unwilling
to move forward, not less from a reluctance to relinquish what
he beholds, than from an apprehension of disturbing, by his
approach, the quietness beneath him. Issuing from the plain
of this valley, the Brook descends in a rapid torrent, passing by
the churchyard of Seathwaite. The traveller is thus conducted
at once into the midst of the wild and beautiful scenery which
gave occasion to the Sonnets from the 14th to the 20th inclusive.
From the point where the Seathwaite Brook joins the Duddon,
is a view upwards, into the pass through which the River makes
its way into the Plain of Donnerdale. The perpendicular rock
on the right bears the ancient British name of <span class="smcap">The Pen</span>; the
one opposite is called <span class="smcap">Walla-Barrow Crag</span>, a name that
occurs in several places to designate rocks of the same character.
The <em>chaotic</em> aspect of the scene is well marked by the expression
of a stranger, who strolled out while dinner was preparing, and,
at his return, being asked by his host, "What way he had been
wandering?" replied, "As far as it is <em>finished</em>!"</p>

<p>The bed of the Duddon is here strewn with large fragments
of rock fallen from aloft; which, as Mr. Green truly says, "are
happily adapted to the many-shaped waterfalls," (or rather
water-breaks, for none of them are high,) "displayed in the
short space of half a mile." That there is some hazard in
frequenting these desolate places, I myself have had proof; for
one night an immense mass of rock fell upon the very spot where,
with a friend, I had lingered the day before. "The concussion,"
says Mr. Green, speaking of the event, (for he also,
in the practice of his art, on that day sat exposed for a still
longer time to the same peril,) "was heard, not without alarm,
by the neighbouring shepherds." But to return to Seathwaite
Churchyard: it contains the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In memory of the Reverend Robert Walker, who died the
25th of June, 1802, in the 93d year of his age, and 67th of his
curacy at Seathwaite.</p>

<p>"Also, of Anne his wife, who died the 28th of January, in
the 93d year of her age."</p>

for his temperance, industry, and integrity."</p>

<h3>MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER</h3>

<p>In the year 1709, Robert Walker was born at Under-crag,
in Seathwaite; he was the youngest of twelve children. His
eldest brother, who inherited the small family estate, died at
Under-crag, aged ninety-four, being twenty-four years older
than the subject of this Memoir, who was born of the same
mother. Robert was a sickly infant; and, through his boyhood
and youth continuing to be of delicate frame and tender
health, it was deemed best, according to the country phrase, to
<em>breed him a scholar</em>; for it was not likely that he would be
able to earn a livelihood by bodily labour. At that period few
of these dales were furnished with school-houses; the children
being taught to read and write in the chapel; and in the same
consecrated building, where he officiated for so many years
both as preacher and schoolmaster, he himself received the
rudiments of his education. In his youth he became schoolmaster
at Loweswater; not being called upon, probably, in
that situation, to teach more than reading, writing, and
arithmetic. But, by the assistance of a "Gentleman" in the
neighbourhood, he acquired, at leisure hours, a knowledge of
the classics, and became qualified for taking holy orders.
Upon his ordination, he had the offer of two curacies: the one,
Torver, in the vale of Coniston,&mdash;the other, Seathwaite, in his
native vale. The value of each was the same, <em>viz.</em> five pounds
<em>per annum</em>: but the cure of Seathwaite having a cottage
attached to it, as he wished to marry, he chose it in preference.
The young person on whom his affections were fixed, though
in the condition of a domestic servant, had given promise, by
her serious and modest deportment, and by her virtuous dispositions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
that she was worthy to become the helpmate of a man entering upon a plan
of life such as he had marked out for himself. By her frugality she had
stored up a small sum of money, with which they began housekeeping. In
1735 or 1736, he entered upon his curacy; and nineteen years afterwards,
his situation is thus described, in some letters to be found in the
Annual Register for 1760, from which the following is extracted:</p>

<p class="center">To Mr. &mdash;&mdash;.<br />
"<span class="smcap">Coniston</span>, <i>July</i> 26, 1754.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"I was the other day upon a party of pleasure, about five
or six miles from this place, where I met with a very striking
object, and of a nature not very common. Going into a clergyman's
house (of whom I had frequently heard), I found him
sitting at the head of a long square table, such as is commonly
used in this country by the lower class of people, dressed in a
coarse blue frock, trimmed with black horn buttons; a checked
shirt, a leathern strap about his neck for a stock, a coarse
apron, and a pair of great wooden-soled shoes plated with iron
to preserve them (what we call clogs in these parts), with a
child upon his knee, eating his breakfast; his wife, and the
remainder of his children, were some of them employed in
waiting upon each other, the rest in teazing and spinning wool,
at which trade he is a great proficient; and moreover, when it
is made ready for sale, will lay it, by sixteen or thirty-two
pounds' weight, upon his back, and on foot, seven or eight
miles, will carry it to the market, even in the depth of winter.
I was not much surprised at all this, as you may possibly be,
having heard a great deal of it related before. But I must
confess myself astonished with the alacrity and the good humour
that appeared both in the clergyman and his wife, and more so
at the sense and ingenuity of the clergyman himself." ...</p></blockquote>

<p>Then follows a letter from another person, dated 1755, from
which an extract shall be given.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"By his frugality and good management, he keeps the wolf
from the door, as we say; and if he advances a little in the
world, it is owing more to his own care, than to anything else
he has to rely upon. I don't find his inclination is running
after further preferment. He is settled among the people, that
are happy among themselves; and lives in the greatest
unanimity and friendship with them; and, I believe, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
minister and people are exceedingly satisfied with each other;
and indeed how should they be dissatisfied when they have a
person of so much worth and probity for their pastor? A man
who, for his candour and meekness, his sober, chaste, and
virtuous conversation, his soundness in principle and practice,
is an ornament to his profession, and an honour to the country
he is in; and bear with me if I say, the plainness of his dress, the
sanctity of his manners, the simplicity of his doctrine, and the
vehemence of his expression, have a sort of resemblance to the
pure practice of primitive Christianity."</p></blockquote>

<p>We will now give his own account of himself, to be found
in the same place.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">From the Rev. <span class="smcap">Robert Walker</span>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Yours of the 26th instant was communicated to me
by Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, and I should have returned an immediate
answer, but the hand of Providence, then laying<a name="FNanchor_GT_669" id="FNanchor_GT_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_GT_669" class="fnanchor">[GT]</a> heavy upon an
amiable pledge of conjugal endearment, hath since taken from
me a promising girl, which the disconsolate mother too pensively
laments the loss of; though we have yet eight living, all
healthful, hopeful children, whose names and ages are as
follows:&mdash;Zaccheus, aged almost eighteen years; Elizabeth,
sixteen years and ten months; Mary, fifteen; Moses, thirteen
years and three months; Sarah, ten years and three months;
Mabel, eight years and three months; William Tyson, three
years and eight months; and Anne Esther, one year and three
months; besides Anne, who died two years and six months
ago, and was then aged between nine and ten; and Eleanor,
who died the 23d inst., January, aged six years and ten
months. Zaccheus, the eldest child, is now learning the trade
of a tanner, and has two years and a half of his apprenticeship to
serve. The annual income of my chapel at present, as near as
I can compute it, may amount to about &pound;17, of which is paid
in cash, viz., &pound;5 from the bounty of Queen Anne, and &pound;5
from W. P., Esq., of P&mdash;&mdash;, out of the annual rents, he being
lord of the manor, and &pound;3 from the several inhabitants of
L&mdash;&mdash;, settled upon the tenements as a rent-charge; the house
and gardens I value at &pound;4 yearly, and not worth more; and I
believe the surplice fees and voluntary contributions, one year
with another, may be worth &pound;3; but as the inhabitants are
few in number, and the fees very low, this last-mentioned sum
consists merely in freewill offerings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am situated greatly to my satisfaction with regard to the
conduct and behaviour of my auditory, who not only live in
the happy ignorance of the follies and vices of the age, but in
mutual peace and goodwill with one another, and are seemingly
(I hope really too) sincere Christians, and sound members of
the Established Church, not one dissenter of any denomination
being amongst them all. I got to the value of &pound;40 for my
wife's fortune, but had no real estate of my own, being the
youngest son of twelve children, born of obscure parents; and,
though my income has been but small, and my family large,
yet, by a providential blessing upon my own diligent endeavours,
the kindness of friends, and a cheap country to live in, we have
always had the necessaries of life. By what I have written
(which is a true and exact account to the best of my knowledge,)
I hope you will not think your favour to me, out of the late
worthy Dr. Stratford's effects, quite misbestowed, for which I
must ever gratefully own myself, Sir, your much obliged and
most obedient humble Servant,</p></blockquote>

<p class="center"><span style="margin-left: 15em;">"R. W., Curate of S&mdash;&mdash;,</span><br />
"To Mr. C., of Lancaster."</p>

<p>About the time when this letter was written, the Bishop of
Chester recommended the scheme of joining the curacy of
Ulpha to the contiguous one of Seathwaite, and the nomination
was offered to Mr. Walker; but an unexpected difficulty
arising, Mr. W., in a letter to the Bishop, (a copy of which,
in his own beautiful handwriting, now lies before me,) thus
expresses himself. "If he," meaning the person in whom the
difficulty originated, "had suggested any such objection before,
I should utterly have declined any attempt to the curacy of
Ulpha: indeed, I was always apprehensive it might be disagreeable
to my auditory at Seathwaite, as they have been
always accustomed to double duty, and the inhabitants of Ulpha
despair of being able to support a schoolmaster who is not
curate there also; which suppressed all thoughts in me of serving
them both." And in a second letter to the Bishop he
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;I have the favour of yours of the 1st instant,
and am exceedingly obliged on account of the Ulpha affair: if
that curacy should lapse into your Lordship's hands, I would
beg leave rather to decline than embrace it; for the chapels of
Seathwaite and Ulpha, annexed together, would be apt to
cause a general discontent among the inhabitants of both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
places; by either thinking themselves slighted, being only
served alternately, or neglected in the duty, or attributing it to
covetousness in me; all which occasions of murmuring I would
willingly avoid." And in concluding his former letter, he expresses
a similar sentiment upon the same occasion, "desiring,
if it be possible, however, as much as in me lieth, to live
peaceably with all men."</p></blockquote>

<p>The year following, the curacy of Seathwaite was again
augmented; and, to effect this augmentation, fifty pounds had
been advanced by himself; and, in 1760, lands were purchased
with eight hundred pounds. Scanty as was his income, the
frequent offer of much better benefices could not tempt Mr. W.
to quit a situation where he had been so long happy, with a
consciousness of being useful. Among his papers I find the
following copy of a letter, dated 1775, twenty years after his
refusal of the curacy of Ulpha, which will show what exertions
had been made for one of his sons.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">May it please your Grace</span>,&mdash;Our remote situation
here makes it difficult to get the necessary information for
transacting business regularly; such is the reason of my giving
your Grace the present trouble.</p>

<p>"The bearer (my son) is desirous of offering himself candidate
for deacon's orders at your Grace's ensuing ordination;
the first, on the 25th instant, so that his papers could not be
transmitted in due time. As he is now fully at age, and I have
afforded him education to the utmost of my ability, it would
give me great satisfaction (if your Grace would take him, and
find him qualified) to have him ordained. His constitution has
been tender for some years; he entered the college of Dublin,
but his health would not permit him to continue there, or I
would have supported him much longer. He has been with
me at home above a year, in which time he has gained great
strength of body, sufficient, I hope, to enable him for performing
the function. Divine Providence, assisted by liberal benefactors,
has blest my endeavours, from a small income, to rear
a numerous family; and as my time of life renders me now
unfit for much future expectancy from this world, I should be
glad to see my son settled in a promising way to acquire an
honest livelihood for himself. His behaviour, so far in life,
has been irreproachable; and I hope he will not degenerate,
in principles or practice, from the precepts and pattern of an
indulgent parent. Your Grace's favourable reception of this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
from a distant corner of the diocese, and an obscure hand, will
excite filial gratitude, and a due use shall be made of the
obligation vouchsafed thereby to Your Grace's very dutiful and
most obedient Son and Servant,</p></blockquote>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Robert Walker.</span>"</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The same man, who was thus liberal in the education of his
numerous family, was even munificent in his hospitality as a
parish priest. Every Sunday, were served, upon the long table,
at which he has been described sitting with a child upon his
knee, messes of broth, for the refreshment of those of his
congregation who came from a distance, and usually took their
seats as parts of his own household. It seems scarcely possible
that this custom could have commenced before the augmentation
of his cure; and what would to many have been a high
price of self-denial, was paid, by the pastor and his family, for
this gratification; as the treat could only be provided by dressing
at one time the whole, perhaps, of their weekly allowance
of fresh animal food; consequently, for a succession of days,
the table was covered with cold victuals only. His generosity
in old age may be still further illustrated by a little circumstance
relating to an orphan grandson, then ten years of age, which I
find in a copy of a letter to one of his sons; he requests that
half-a-guinea may be left for "little Robert's pocket-money,"
who was then at school: intrusting it to the care of a lady,
who, as he says, "may sometimes frustrate his squandering it
away foolishly," and promising to send him an equal allowance
annually for the same purpose. The conclusion of the same
letter is so characteristic, that I cannot forbear to transcribe it.
"We," meaning his wife and himself, "are in our wonted
state of health, allowing for the hasty strides of old age knocking
daily at our door, and threateningly telling us, we are not
only mortal, but must expect ere long to take our leave of our
ancient cottage, and lie down in our last dormitory. Pray
pardon my neglect to answer yours; let us hear sooner from
you, to augment the mirth of the Christmas holidays. Wishing
you all the pleasures of the approaching season, I am, dear Son,
with lasting sincerity, yours affectionately,</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Robert Walker.</span>"</p>

<p>He loved old customs and usages, and in some instances
stuck to them to his own loss; for, having had a sum of money
lodged in the hands of a neighbouring tradesman, when long
course of time had raised the rate of interest, and more was
offered, he refused to accept it; an act not difficult to one, who,
while he was drawing seventeen pounds a year from his curacy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
declined, as we have seen, to add the profits of another small
benefice to his own, lest he should be suspected of cupidity.
From this vice he was utterly free; he made no charge for
teaching school; such as could afford to pay, gave him what
they pleased. When very young, having kept a diary of his
expenses, however trifling, the large amount, at the end of the
year, surprised him; and from that time the rule of his life was
to be economical, not avaricious. At his decease he left behind
him no less a sum than <em>&pound;</em>2000; and such a sense of his various
excellencies was prevalent in the country, that the epithet of
<span class="smcap">wonderful</span> is to this day attached to his name.</p>

<p>There is in the above sketch something so extraordinary as
to require further <em>explanatory</em> details.&mdash;And to begin with his
industry; eight hours in each day, during five days in the week,
and half of Saturday, except when the labours of husbandry
were urgent, he was occupied in teaching. His seat was within
the rails of the altar; the communion-table was his desk; and,
like Shenstone's schoolmistress, the master employed himself
at the spinning-wheel, while the children were repeating their
lessons by his side. Every evening, after school hours, if not
more profitably engaged, he continued the same kind of labour,
exchanging, for the benefit of exercise, the small wheel, at
which he had sate, for the large one on which wool is spun, the
spinner stepping to and fro. Thus, was the wheel constantly
in readiness to prevent the waste of a moment's time. Nor
was his industry with the pen, when occasion called for it, less
eager. Intrusted with extensive management of public and
private affairs, he acted, in his rustic neighbourhood, as
scrivener, writing out petitions, deeds of conveyance, wills,
covenants, etc., with pecuniary gain to himself, and to the great
benefit of his employers. These labours (at all times considerable)
at one period of the year, viz., between Christmas and
Candlemas, when money transactions are settled in this country,
were often so intense, that he passed great part of the night,
and sometimes whole nights, at his desk. His garden also was
tilled by his own hand; he had a right of pasturage upon the
mountains for a few sheep and a couple of cows, which required
his attendance; with this pastoral occupation, he joined the
labours of husbandry upon a small scale, renting two or three
acres in addition to his own less than one acre of glebe; and
the humblest drudgery which the cultivation of these fields
required was performed by himself.</p>

<p>He also assisted his neighbours in haymaking and shearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
their flocks, and in the performance of this latter service he
was eminently dexterous. They, in their turn, complimented
him with the present of a haycock, or a fleece; less as a recompense
for this particular service than as a general acknowledgment.
The Sabbath was in a strict sense kept holy; the
Sunday evenings being devoted to reading the Scripture and
family prayer. The principal festivals appointed by the Church
were also duly observed; but through every other day in the
week, through every week in the year he was incessantly
occupied in work of hand or mind; not allowing a moment for
recreation, except upon a Saturday afternoon, when he indulged
himself with a Newspaper, or sometimes with a Magazine. The
frugality and temperance established in his house, were as
admirable as the industry. Nothing to which the name of
luxury could be given was there known; in the latter part of
his life, indeed, when tea had been brought into almost general
use, it was provided for visitors, and for such of his own family
as returned occasionally to his roof, and had been accustomed
to this refreshment elsewhere; but neither he nor his wife ever
partook of it. The raiment worn by his family was comely and
decent, but as simple as their diet; the home-spun materials
were made up into apparel by their own hands. At the time of
the decease of this thrifty pair, their cottage contained a large
store of webs of woollen and linen cloth, woven from thread of
their own spinning. And it is remarkable that the pew in the
chapel in which the family used to sit, remains neatly lined
with woollen cloth spun by the pastor's own hands. It is the
only pew in the chapel so distinguished; and I know of no
other instance of his conformity to the delicate accommodations
of modern times. The fuel of the house, like that of their
neighbours, consisted of peat, procured from the mosses by their
own labour. The lights by which, in the winter evenings,
their work was performed, were of their own manufacture, such
as still continue to be used in these cottages; they are made of
the pith of rushes dipped in any unctuous substance that the
house affords. <em>White</em> candles, as tallow candles are here called,
were reserved to honour the Christmas festivals, and were perhaps
produced upon no other occasions. Once a month, during
the proper season, a sheep was drawn from their small mountain
flock, and killed for the use of the family; and a cow,
towards the close of the year, was salted and dried for winter
provision: the hide was tanned to furnish them with shoes.&mdash;By
these various resources, this venerable clergyman reared a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
numerous family, not only preserving them, as he affectingly
says, "from wanting the necessaries of life"; but affording
them an unstinted education, and the means of raising themselves
in society. In this they were eminently assisted by the
effects of their father's example, his precepts, and injunctions:
he was aware that truth-speaking, as a moral virtue, is best
secured by inculcating attention to accuracy of report even on
trivial occasions; and so rigid were the rules of honesty by
which he endeavoured to bring up his family, that if one of
them had chanced to find in the lanes or fields anything of the least
use or value without being able to ascertain to whom it belonged,
he always insisted upon the child's carrying it back to the place
from which it had been brought.<a name="FNanchor_GU_670" id="FNanchor_GU_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_GU_670" class="fnanchor">[GU]</a></p>

<p>No one it might be thought could, as has been described,
convert his body into a machine, as it were, of industry for the
humblest uses, and keep his thoughts so frequently bent upon
secular concerns, without grievous injury to the more precious
parts of his nature. How could the powers of intellect thrive,
or its graces be displayed, in the midst of circumstances apparently
so unfavourable, and where, to the direct cultivation of
the mind, so small a portion of time was allotted? But, in this
extraordinary man, things in their nature adverse were reconciled.
His conversation was remarkable, not only for being
chaste and pure, but for the degree in which it was fervent and
eloquent; his written style was correct, simple, and animated.
Nor did his <em>affections</em> suffer more than his intellect; he was
tenderly alive to all the duties of his pastoral office: the poor
and needy "he never sent empty away," the stranger was fed
and refreshed in passing that unfrequented vale,&mdash;the sick were
visited; and the feelings of humanity found further exercise
among the distresses and embarrassments in the worldly estate
of his neighbours, with which his talents for business made him
acquainted; and the disinterestedness, impartiality, and uprightness
which he maintained in the management of all affairs
confided to him, were virtues seldom separated in his own conscience
from religious obligation. Nor could such conduct fail
to remind those who witnessed it of a spirit nobler than law or
custom: they felt convictions which, but for such intercourse,
could not have been afforded, that, as in the practice of their
pastor, there was no guile, so in his faith there was nothing
hollow; and we are warranted in believing, that upon these
occasions, selfishness, obstinacy, and discord would often give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
way before the breathings of his goodwill and saintly integrity.
It may be presumed also&mdash;while his humble congregation were
listening to the moral precepts which he delivered from the
pulpit, and to the Christian exhortations that they should love
their neighbours as themselves, and do as they would be done
unto&mdash;that peculiar efficacy was given to the preacher's labours
by recollections in the minds of his congregation, that they were
called upon to do no more than his own actions were daily
setting before their eyes.</p>

<p>The afternoon service in the chapel was less numerously
attended than that of the morning, but by a more serious
auditory; the lesson from the New Testament, on those
occasions, was accompanied by Burkitt's Commentaries. These
lessons he read with impassioned emphasis, frequently drawing
tears from his hearers, and leaving a lasting impression upon
their minds. His devotional feelings and the powers of his own
mind were further exercised, along with those of his family, in
perusing the Scriptures: not only on the Sunday evenings, but
on every other evening, while the rest of the household were at
work, some one of the children, and in her turn the servant, for
the sake of practice in reading, or for instruction, read the Bible
aloud; and in this manner the whole was repeatedly gone
through. That no common importance was attached to the
observance of religious ordinances by his family, appears from
the following memorandum by one of his descendants, which I
am tempted to insert at length, as it is characteristic, and
somewhat curious. "There is a small chapel in the county
palatine of Lancaster, where a certain clergyman has regularly
officiated above sixty years, and a few months ago administered
the sacrament of the Lord's Supper in the same, to a decent
number of devout communicants. After the clergyman had
received himself, the first company out of the assembly who
approached the altar, and kneeled down to be partakers of the
sacred elements, consisted of the parson's wife, to whom he had
been married upwards of sixty years; one son and his wife;
four daughters, each with her husband; whose ages, all
added together, amount to above 714 years. The several
and respective distances from the place of each of their abodes,
to the chapel where they all communicated, will measure more
than 1000 English miles. Though the narration will appear
surprising, it is without doubt a fact that the same persons,
exactly four years before, met at the same place, and all joined
in performance of the same venerable duty."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>He was indeed most zealously attached to the doctrine and
frame of the Established Church. We have seen him congratulating
himself that he had no dissenters in his cure of any
denomination. Some allowance must be made for the state of
opinion when his first religious impressions were received,
before the reader will acquit him of bigotry, when I mention,
that at the time of the augmentation of the cure, he refused to
invest part of the money in the purchase of an estate offered to
him upon advantageous terms, because the proprietor was a
Quaker;&mdash;whether from scrupulous apprehension that a blessing
would not attend a contract framed for the benefit of the
church between persons not in religious sympathy with each
other; or, as a seeker of peace, he was afraid of the uncomplying
disposition which at one time was too frequently
conspicuous in that sect. Of this an instance had fallen
under his own notice; for, while he taught school at Loweswater,
certain persons of that denomination had refused to pay
annual interest due<a name="FNanchor_GV_671" id="FNanchor_GV_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_GV_671" class="fnanchor">[GV]</a> under the title of Church-stock;<a name="FNanchor_GW_672" id="FNanchor_GW_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_GW_672" class="fnanchor">[GW]</a> a great
hardship upon the incumbent, for the curacy of Loweswater
was then scarcely less poor than that of Seathwaite. To what
degree this prejudice of his was blameable need not be determined;&mdash;certain
it is, that he was not only desirous, as he
himself says, to live in peace, but in love, with all men. He
was placable, and charitable in his judgments; and, however
correct in conduct and rigorous to himself, he was ever ready
to forgive the trespasses of others, and to soften the censure
that was cast upon their frailties.&mdash;It would be unpardonable
to omit that, in the maintenance of his virtues, he received due
support from the partner of his long life. She was equally
strict, in attending to her share of their joint cares, nor less
diligent in her appropriate occupations. A person who had
been some time their servant in the latter part of their lives,
concluded the panegyric of her mistress by saying to me, "She
was no less excellent than her husband; she was good to the
poor, she was good to every thing!" He survived for a short
time this virtuous companion. When she died, he ordered that
her body should be borne to the grave by three of her daughters
and one grand-daughter; and, when the corpse was lifted from
the threshold, he insisted upon lending his aid, and feeling about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
for he was then almost blind, took hold of a napkin fixed to
the coffin; and, as a bearer of the body, entered the chapel, a
few steps from the lowly parsonage.</p>

<p>What a contrast does the life of this obscurely-seated, and,
in point of worldly wealth, poorly-repaid Churchman, present
to that of a Cardinal Wolsey!</p>

<p>We have been dwelling upon images of peace in the moral
world, that have brought us again to the quiet enclosure of
consecrated ground, in which this venerable pair lie interred.
The sounding brook, that rolls close by the churchyard, without
disturbing feeling or meditation, is now unfortunately laid
bare; but not long ago it participated, with the chapel, the
shade of some stately ash-trees, which will not spring again.
While the spectator from this spot is looking round upon the
girdle of stony mountains that encompasses the vale,&mdash;masses
of rock, out of which monuments for all men that ever existed
might have been hewn&mdash;it would surprise him to be told, as
with truth he might be, that the plain blue slab dedicated to
the memory of this aged pair is a production of a quarry in
North Wales. It was sent as a mark of respect by one of their
descendants from the vale of Festiniog, a region almost as
beautiful as that in which it now lies!</p>

<p>Upon the Seathwaite Brook, at a small distance from the
parsonage, has been erected a mill for spinning yarn; it is a
mean and disagreeable object, though not unimportant to the
spectator, as calling to mind the momentous changes wrought
by such inventions in the frame of society&mdash;changes which
have proved especially unfavourable to these mountain solitudes.
So much had been effected by those new powers, before the
subject of the preceding biographical sketch closed his life,
that their operation could not escape his notice, and doubtless
excited touching reflections upon the comparatively insignificant
results of his own manual industry. But Robert Walker was
not a man of times and circumstances: had he lived at a later
period, the principle of duty would have produced application
as unremitting; the same energy of character would have been
displayed, though in many instances with widely different
effects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>With pleasure I annex, as illustrative and confirmatory of
the above account, extracts from a paper in the <cite>Christian
Remembrancer</cite>, October 1819: it bears an assumed signature,
but is known to be the work of the Rev. Robert Bamford,
vicar of Bishopton, in the county of Durham; a great-grandson
of Mr. Walker, whose worth it commemorates, by a record not
the less valuable for being written in very early youth.</p>

<p>"His house was a nursery of virtue. All the inmates were
industrious, and cleanly, and happy. Sobriety, neatness,
quietness, characterised the whole family. No railings, no
idleness, no indulgence of passion were permitted. Every
child, however young, had its appointed engagements; every
hand was busy. Knitting, spinning, reading, writing, mending
clothes, making shoes, were by the different children constantly
performing. The father himself sitting amongst them,
and guiding their thoughts, was engaged in the same
occupations....</p>

<p>"He sate up late, and rose early; when the family were at
rest, he retired to a little room which he had built on the roof
of his house. He had slated it, and fitted it up with shelves
for his books, his stock of cloth, wearing apparel, and his
utensils. There many a cold winter's night, without fire,
while the roof was glazed with ice, did he remain reading or
writing, till the day dawned. He taught the children in the
chapel, for there was no schoolhouse. Yet in that cold, damp
place he never had a fire. He used to send the children in
parties either to his own fire at home, or make them run up
the mountain side.</p>

<p class="center">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>"It may be further mentioned, that he was a passionate
admirer of Nature; she was his mother, and he was a dutiful
child. While engaged on the mountains, it was his greatest
pleasure to view the rising sun; and in tranquil evenings, as it
slided behind the hills, he blessed its departure. He was
skilled in fossils and plants; a constant observer of the stars
and winds: the atmosphere was his delight. He made many
experiments on its nature and properties. In summer he used
to gather a multitude of flies and insects, and, by his entertaining
description, amuse and instruct his children. They shared
all his daily employments, and derived many sentiments of love
and benevolence from his observations on the works and productions
of nature. Whether they were following him in the
field, or surrounding him in school, he took every opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
of storing their minds with useful information.&mdash;Nor was the
circle of his influence confined to Seathwaite. Many a distant
mother has told her child of Mr. Walker, and begged him to be
as good a man.</p>

<p class="center">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>"Once, when I was very young, I had the pleasure of
seeing and hearing that venerable old man in his 90th year,
and even then, the calmness, the force, the perspicuity of his
sermon, sanctified and adorned by the wisdom of grey hairs,
and the authority of virtue, had such an effect upon my mind,
that I never see a hoary-headed clergyman, without thinking
of Mr. Walker.... He allowed no dissenter or methodist to
interfere in the instruction of the souls committed to his cure:
and so successful were his exertions, that he had not one
dissenter of any denomination whatever in the whole parish.
Though he avoided all religious controversies, yet when age
had silvered his head, and virtuous piety had secured to his
appearance reverence and silent honour, no one, however
determined in his hatred of apostolic descent, could have
listened to his discourse on ecclesiastical history and ancient
times, without thinking, that one of the beloved apostles had
returned to mortality, and in that vale of peace had come to
exemplify the beauty of holiness in the life and character of Mr.
Walker.</p>

<p class="center">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>

<p>"Until the sickness of his wife, a few months previous to
her death, his health and spirits and faculties were unimpaired.
But this misfortune gave him such a shock, that his constitution
gradually decayed. His senses, except sight, still preserved
their powers. He never preached with steadiness after his
wife's death. His voice faltered: he always looked at the seat
she had used. He could not pass her tomb without tears. He
became, when alone, sad and melancholy, though still among
his friends kind and good-humoured. He went to bed about
twelve o'clock the night before his death. As his custom was,
he went, tottering and leaning upon his daughter's arm, to
examine the heavens, and meditate a few moments in the open
air. 'How clear the moon shines to-night!' He said these
words, sighed, and laid down. At six next morning he was
found a corpse. Many a tear, and many a heavy heart, and
many a grateful blessing followed him to the grave."<a name="FNanchor_GY_674" id="FNanchor_GY_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_GY_674" class="fnanchor">[GY]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>Having mentioned in this narrative the vale of Loweswater
as a place where Mr. Walker taught school, I will add a few
memoranda from its parish register, respecting a person apparently
of desires as moderate, with whom he must have been
intimate during his residence there.</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Let him that would, ascend the tottering seat</div>
  <div class="i0">Of courtly grandeur, and become as great</div>
  <div class="i0">As are his mounting wishes; but for me,</div>
  <div class="i0">Let sweet repose and rest my portion be.</div>
  <div class="i8"><span class="smcap">Henry Forest</span>, Curate."</div>
 </div>
</div>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Honour, the idol which the most adore,</div>
  <div class="i0">Receives no homage from my knee;</div>
  <div class="i0">Content in privacy I value more</div>
  <div class="i0">Than all uneasy dignity."</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>"Henry Forest came to Loweswater, 1708, being twenty-five
years of age."</p>

<p>"This curacy was twice augmented by Queen Anne's
Bounty. The first payment, with great difficulty, was paid to
Mr. John Curwen of London, on the 9th of May, 1724,
deposited by me, Henry Forest, curate of Loweswater. Y<sup>e</sup>
said 9th of May, y<sup>e</sup> said Mr. Curwen went to the office, and
saw my name registered there, etc. This, by the Providence
of God, came by lot to this poor place.</p>

<p class="center">"Hæc testor <span class="smcap">H. Forest</span>."</p>

<p>In another place he records, that the sycamore trees were
planted in the churchyard in 1710.</p>

<p>He died in 1741, having been curate thirty-four years. It
is not improbable that H. Forest was the gentleman who
assisted Robert Walker in his classical studies at Loweswater.</p>

<p>To this parish register is prefixed a motto, of which the
following verses are a part:&mdash;</p>

hard upon the personal appearance of the worthy Poissardes of

observer, used to say of them, that their features and countenances
seemed to have conformed to those of the creatures they
dealt in; at all events the resemblance was striking."&mdash;W. W.

1821), she calls "hasty notes made by snatches during our
journey,"&mdash;the following occurs:&mdash;"Passing through the gates
of the city, we had before us a line of white-capped Fish-women,
with thin brown faces. The fish very foul, yet at dinner the
same sort proved excellent."</p>

<p>In Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal of the same Tour, the
following occurs:&mdash;"Tuesday, 11th July. Calais.&mdash;With one
consent we stopped to gaze at a group&mdash;rather a <em>line</em> of women
and girls, seated beside dirty fish baskets under the old gate-way
and ramparts&mdash;their white night caps, brown and puckered faces,
bright eyes, etc. etc., very striking. The arrangements&mdash;how
unlike those of a fish-market in the South of England!...</p>

<p>"Every one is struck with the excessive ugliness (if I may
apply the word to any <em>human</em> creatures) of the fish-women of
Calais, and <em>that</em> no one can forget."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>Henry Crabb Robinson wrote of this sonnet:&mdash;"Of the
sonnets there is one remarkable and <em>unique</em>; the humour and
naïveté, and the exquisitely refined sentiment of the Calais fish-women,
are a combination of excellencies quite novel." (<cite>Diary,
etc.</cite>, vol. ii. p. 224.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>"In this city are many vestiges of the splendour of the
Burgundian Dukedom, and the long black mantle universally
worn by the females is probably a remnant of the old Spanish
connection, which, if I do not much deceive myself, is traceable
in the grave deportment of its inhabitants. Bruges is comparatively
little disturbed by that curious contest, or rather
conflict, of Flemish with French propensities in matters of taste,
so conspicuous through other parts of Flanders. The hotel to
which we drove at Ghent furnished an odd instance. In the
passages were paintings and statues, after the antique, of Hebe
and Apollo; and in the garden, a little pond, about a yard and a
half in diameter, with a weeping willow bending over it, and
under the shade of that tree, in the centre of the pond a wooden
painted statue of a Dutch or Flemish boor, looking ineffably
tender upon his mistress, and embracing her. A living duck,
tethered at the feet of the sculptured lovers, alternately tormented
a miserable eel and itself with endeavours to escape from its
bonds and prison. Had we chanced to espy the hostess of the
hotel in this quaint rural retreat, the exhibition would have
been complete. She was a true Flemish figure, in the dress of
the days of Holbein; her symbol of office, a weighty bunch of
keys, pendent from her portly waist. In Brussels, the modern
taste in costume, architecture, etc., has got the mastery; in
Ghent there is a struggle: but in Bruges old images are still
paramount, and an air of monastic life among the quiet goings-on
of a thinly-peopled city is inexpressibly soothing; a pensive
grace seems to be cast over all, even the very children."
(Extract from Journal.)&mdash;W. W. 1822.</p>

<p>From Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal:&mdash;"Thursday, 13th July....&mdash;Bruges.
What a place. D. and I walked out as soon
as we could after our arrival.... Went into the old church.
The nuns, the different worshippers, the pictures, the place, the
quiet stately streets, grand buildings, graceful nun-like women
in their long cloaks, treading with swan-like motions those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
silent avenues of majestic architecture, I must leave to D. to
describe. My own mind was uplifted by a sort of devotional
elevation as if striving to fit itself to become worthy of what
these temples would lead to."</p>

<p>"... Friday, 14th.&mdash;At Bruges all is silence, grace, and
unmixed dignity.... You felt a sort of veneration for everything
you looked upon. Nothing of this here" [<i>i.e.</i> at Ghent];
"yet what a splendid place! The evening too suited its
character, for the sun went down in brightness. Yesterday
was not a sunny day, and Bruges wanted no sunshine, its own
outline in the gloom of evening needed no golden lustre. Yet
<em>this</em> William witnessed, when D. and I were not with him, the
great Tower of the Market House bathed in gold!"</p>

<p>The following is from Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal:&mdash;"Thursday,
13th July. Dunkirk.&mdash;We entered Bruges by a
long gently-winding street, and were so animated with pleasure
in our hasty course that it seemed we too soon reached the inn.
W. and Mr. M. walked out immediately, eager to view the
city in the warm light of the setting sun....</p>

<p>"Continued to walk through the silent town till ten o'clock&mdash;no
carts&mdash;no chaises&mdash;a cloistral silence felt in every corner and
every open space, yet the large square was scattered over with
groups of people; or passengers walking to and fro, no lights in
the houses!"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>See the note to the last sonnet. The following is from Mrs.
Wordsworth's Journal:&mdash;"Friday, 14th. Bruges.&mdash;Rose at
five o'clock, paced the town again, and visited, but with disturbed
mind (for I had left William in bed hurting himself with
a sonnet), the churches of St. Salvador and Notre Dame....
I joined W. in our carriage, and have here written down the
sonnet, Jones' Parsonage, so I hope he will be at rest."</p>

<p>The following is from Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal:&mdash;"Friday,
14th July. Bruges.&mdash;The morning was bright, sunshine
and shade falling upon the lines of houses, and the out-juttings
of the more noble buildings. In the bright light of
morning the same tender melancholy was over the city as in
the sober time of twilight, yet with intervening images of rural
life. A few peasants were now entering the town, and the
rattling of a rustic cart, prettily laden with vegetables fresh from
the soil, gave a gentle stirring to the fancy. Early as it was,
people of all ages were abroad chiefly on their way to the
churches: the figure, gait, and motions of the women in
harmony with the collegiate air of the streets, and the processions
and solemnities of Catholic worship. Such figures
might have walked through these streets, two hundred
years ago; streets bearing no stamp of progress or of decay.
One might fancy that as the city had been built so it had
remained. We first went to the Church of St. Salvador, a
venerable Gothic edifice. Within the Church, our walk between
the lofty pillars was very solemn. We saw in perspective
the marble floor scattered over, at irregular distances, with
people of all ages&mdash;standing, or upon their knees, silent, yet
making such motions as the order of their devotions prescribed,
crossing themselves, beating their breasts, or telling their beads.
Such the general appearance of the worshippers: but the
gestures of some were more impassioned....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>"We spent some time in admiring the beauty of the choir,
and every other part of this noble building, adorned as it is
with statues; and pictures not in the paltry style of the
Churches at Calais and Fernes; but works of art that would
be interesting <em>anywhere</em>, and are much more so in these sacred
places, where the wretched and the happy, the poor and the
rich are alike invited to cast away worldly feelings, and may
be elevated by the representations of Scripture history, or of the
sufferings and glory of martyrs and saints."</p>

<p>In the final arrangement of his poems, Wordsworth placed
the one entitled <cite>Incident at Brugès</cite>&mdash;which belonged to the
year 1828&mdash;after the two sonnets on Brugès in these "Memorials
of a Tour on the Continent in 1820." In the present edition
the former poem is restored to its chronological place (see vol.
vii.), where it is associated with <cite>A Jewish Family</cite>. As a consequence
the numbering of the poems differs slightly from that
which Wordsworth finally adopted.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>"Namur, Tuesday 18th.&mdash;Our ride yesterday, except for
the intervention of Waterloo, and its interests, which were
so melancholy that I do not like to touch upon them, was a
dull one, though the road was pleasant through the forest of
Soignies. Waterloo, its pretty chapel, the walls within covered
with monuments, recording the fall of many of our brave
countrymen, and some few others as brave, La Haye Sainte,
La Belle Alliance, Quatre Bras. Dined at Genappe; two
bullet shots in the wainscot of the room, which, during the
battle, had been heaped with dead and dying." (From Mrs.
Wordsworth's Journal.)</p>

<p>"Monday, 17th July, Brussels.&mdash;I could understand little
till we got to the field of battle, where we stood upon an
elevation; and thence, looking round upon every memorable
spot, by help of gesture and action, and the sounds 'les
Anglois, les Francois,' etc. etc., I gathered up a small portion
of the story, helped out by a few monuments erected to the
memory of the slain; but all round, there was no other visible
record of slaughter: the wide fields were covered with
luxuriant crops, just as they had been before the battles, except
that now the corn was nearly ripe, and <em>then</em> it was green. We
stood upon grass, and corn fields where <em>heaps</em> of our countrymen
lay buried beneath our feet. There was little to be seen,
but much to be felt; sorrow and sadness, and even something
like horror breathed out of the ground as we stood upon it!"

<blockquote><p>[The scenery on the Meuse pleases me more, upon the whole,

in grandeur. The rocks, both in form and colour, especially
between Namur and Liege, surpass any upon the Rhine, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
they are in several places disfigured by quarries, whence stones
were taken for the new fortifications. This is much to be regretted,
for they are useless, and the scars will remain perhaps
for thousands of years. A like injury to a still greater degree
has been inflicted, in my memory, upon the beautiful rocks
of Clifton, on the banks of the Avon. There is probably in
existence a very long letter of mine to Sir Uvedale Price, in
which was given a description of the landscapes on the Meuse
as compared with those on the Rhine.</p>

<p>Details in the spirit of these sonnets are given both in Mrs.
Wordsworth's Journals and my Sister's, and the reperusal of
them has strengthened a wish long entertained that somebody
would put together, as in one work, the notices contained in
them, omitting particulars that were written down merely to
aid our memory, and bringing the whole into as small a

<p>"July 18. Departure from <em>Namur</em>, road out of the town
beautiful, wide, disk-like valley, gardens, groves, town standing
upon its two rivers. Ramparts towering above, very impressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
to cast the eyes back upon. Market people flocking in in groups,
variety of dresses, of all gay colours. Flowers seem to be the
delight of the peasantry. They are worn in their hats, upon
their breasts, carried in the mouth when their hands are at
work sometimes, or stuck behind the ear. Road excellent all
the way down the Meuse. Villages in all situations,&mdash;among
the rocks, now one peeps out of a recess, again another upon a
knoll with its spire rising from among trees. More and more
beautiful as you proceed down the river&mdash;rocks on the banks of
the most fantastic forms, something like those on the Wye.
Sometimes the valley reminded us of the trough of the Clyde.
<em>Huy.</em> Church handsome, the high tower struck by lightning
fourteen years ago; new fortifications, most picturesque and
romantic situation. Crossed the Meuse here, charming view
from the bridge.... Road very delightful, rocks, woods,
chateau, convent, vineyards, hanging gardens, orchards with
profusion of fruit, shrubs, and flowers, and corn lands, all in
the most luxuriant state. So beautiful a day's journey I never
before travelled."</p>

<p>The following is from Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal,
vol. i.:&mdash;"Tuesday, July 18. Namur.&mdash;Having traversed the
Vale, we travel downwards, with the stately, though muddy, river
to our left&mdash;pass under limestone rocks resembling abbeys or
castles&mdash;the opening prospect still presenting something new.
Backwards, a noble view of the vale, terminated by the city
and fortifications of Namur at the distance of, perhaps, two
miles or more&mdash;our last farewell view! Still, as we go on, the
rocks change their shapes, in prospect far off; or as we roll
swiftly away beneath them. Villages not to be numbered by
the hasty traveller, rise up, with spires and towers; cottages
embowered in gardens and orchards, and sometimes an old
chateau or modern villa. All these (in succession or together)
vary the scene, while, the abundance of flowers, fruit, vegetables,
and corn, interbedded and intermingled, give an image of
plenty and happy industry."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Where unremitting frosts the rocky crescent bleach.</em></p>

<p>"Let a wall of rocks be imagined from three to six hundred
feet in height, and rising between France and Spain, so as
physically to separate the two kingdoms&mdash;let us fancy this wall
curved like a crescent with its convexity towards France.
Lastly, let us suppose, that in the very middle of the wall a
breach of 300 feet wide has been beaten down by the famous
<cite>Roland</cite>, and we may have a good idea of what the mountaineers
call the '<span class="smcap">Breche de Rolend</span>.'" (<cite>Raymond's Pyrenees.</cite>)&mdash;W. W.
1822.</p>

<p>"Thursday, 20th July.&mdash;... Descend towards the town of
Aix-la-Chapelle, a chapel on the opposite side of the vale upon
a high knoll, overlooking the spires and towers.... Wm.,
T. M., and myself walked to the chapel we had seen on the
heights, said to be built by Charlemagne: a very interesting
view of the town, and over a large space of the country beyond,
and <em>into</em> the country looking the other way. Wm. went higher
to a monument recording that Buonaparte visited the spot with
one attendant. We were too late to be satisfied here, the
darkness only allowing us to form a notion of the outline, and
to catch here and there a spire or a tower in the distance. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
chapel here alluded to was not larger in appearance than the
tiny rocky edifice at Buttermere. A Christ under the branches
of a spreading oak, brought to my mind by contrast, a gay
image of a brightly painted fox, on a sign board, among the
branches of a flowing chestnut tree, which William and I saw
gleaming in the setting sun, when walking through the village
of Souldren." (From Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.)</p>

<p>"Thursday, 20th July. Aix-la-Chapelle.&mdash;I went to the
Cathedral, a curious Building where are to be seen the chair of
Charlemagne, on which the Emperors were formerly crowned,
some marble pillars much older than <em>his</em> time; and many
pictures; but I could not stay to examine any of these curiosities,
and gladly made my way alone back to the inn to rest there.
The market-place is a fine old square; but at Aix-la-Chapelle
there is always a mighty preponderance of poverty and dulness,
except in a few of the showiest of the streets, and even there, a
flashy meanness, a slight patchery of things falling to pieces is
everywhere visible." (From Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal,
vol. i.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>"Friday, July 21. Cologne.&mdash;... The Cathedral, a most
magnificent edifice. Tower unfinished (this I perceived, but
took it for a ruin at ten miles distance), built 700 years ago.
The outside reminds you of Westminster Abbey in parts; and,
had the Projector's wish been fulfilled, within and without, this
would have been a much more sumptuous pile. It affectingly
called to my mind William's lines&mdash;</p>

 </div>
</div>

<p>Within the fluted Pillars are very grand; the dimensions, 180
German feet high, 700 long, and 500 broad. A curious old
picture, 450 years old. Subject, the 3 Kings of Cologne in
the centre (for it was divided into three parts, and kept shut up
to protect it), and on the sides Ursula and the 11,000 virgins,
by Ralfe; mounted 250 steps to the top of the unfinished
Tower, and had a fine prospect of the river winding its way
towards Dusseldorf.... The cathedral&mdash;that august and
solemnly <em>impressive</em> Temple.... William in his musing
way...." (From Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.)</p>

<p>"Friday, 21st July. Cologne.&mdash;I cannot attempt to describe
the Cathedral; nor indeed could any skill of mine do justice to
that august pile, even if I might have lingered half a day among
its walls. At our entrance, the evening sunshine rested upon
portions of some of the hundred massy columns; while the
shade and gloom, spread through the edifice, were deepened by
those brilliant touches of golden light. Some of the painted
windows were beautified by the melting together and the intermingling
of colours, reflected upon the stone-work, colours and
shapes, to the eye as unsubstantial as light itself, and visionary
as the rainbow. The choir is hung with tapestry, designed by
Rubens. It does, I think, to an unlearned eye somewhat resemble
Henry the Seventh's chapel at Westminster, but is much loftier
and larger. The long lancet-shaped painted windows are
beautiful. The pillars and arches through the aisles of this
Cathedral are of grey stone, sober, solemn, of great size, yet
exquisitely proportioned; and no paltry images or tinselled
altars disturb the one impression of awful magnificence, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
impression received at once, and not to be overcome by regrets,
that <em>only</em> the <em>Choir</em> and side aisles are finished. The nave, at
half its destined height, is covered with a ceiling of boards.
The exterior of this stupendous edifice is of massy, though most
<em>beautiful</em>, architecture. Some of the lighter wreaths of stone-work
(if great things may be compared with small) made me
think of the Chapel of Roslin in its sequestered dell, where the
adder's tongue and fern are mingled with green-grown flowers,
and leaves of stone that neither fall nor fade. Flowers and
bushes here grow out of the gigantic ruins&mdash;yet <em>ruins</em> they are
not; for as the Builder's hand left the unfinished work, so it
appears to have remained in firmness and strength unshakable,
while Nature has made her own of ornaments framed in
imitation of her works, having overspread them with her colouring,
and blended them with the treasures of her lonely places."

<p>"Saturday 22nd.&mdash;We were anxious, at least Wm. was, to
be in Switzerland, and we must follow our destiny. Leaving
the rich plain, came to the fine range of mountains we saw
yesterday, and to the side of the glorious river, by which we
have since travelled. Magnificent heights on its banks. The
most abrupt and fantastic outlines; Convents (what an exquisite
one that first which pushed itself forward on the green shore,
where the river bends in its course); Ruined Castles, looking
at each other from aloft, or down upon the convents, lurk in
the woody clefts; picturesque Villages with their spires, at
every turn of this stately winding river; beautiful road following
its windings; every variety of form given to the rocks; and
affecting intimations brought to mind, by the frequent oratories
and crosses, here neither tawdry nor obtrusive. After changing
horses at <cite>Remengen</cite>, lost sight for a while of our noble
companion, which soon reappeared stretching along a more
widely-spread vale; the green hills softly retiring, vineyards climbing
up their sides, and into every crevice; corn yellow-green, the
different crops richly filling the centre of the vale; the fine road,
bordered now by apple-trees laden with fruit, now open to the
undivided plain. Again the hills approached, and never was
beheld a grander display of Nature's works and of human Art,
than continued in succession to feast our eyes and imaginations.
D. noted the objects <em>individually</em>, in one of the most beautiful
passages" (of her journal). (Mrs. Wordsworth.)</p>

<p>"Saturday, 22nd July. Cologne.&mdash;For some miles, the
traveller goes through the magnificent plain, which from its
great width appears almost circular. Though <em>unseen</em> the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
Rhine, we never can forget that it is there! When the vale
becomes narrower, one of the most interesting and beautiful of
prospects opens on the view from a gentle rising in the road.
On an island stands a large grey convent, sadly pensive among
its garden walls and embowering wood. The musket and
cannon have spared that sanctuary, and we were told that,
though the establishment is dissolved, a few of the nuns still
remain there, attached to the spot; or probably having neither
friends or other home to repair to. On the right bank of the
river, opposite to us, is a bold precipice, bearing on its summit
a ruined fortress which looks down upon the convent; and the
warlike and religious Edifices are connected together by a
chivalrous story of slighted or luckless love, which caused the
withdrawing of a fair Damsel to the Island, where she founded
the monastery. Another bold ruin stands upon an eminence
adjoining, and all these monuments of former times combine
with villages and churches, and dells (between the steeps) green
or corn-clad, and with the majestic River (here spread out like
a lake) to compose a most affectingly beautiful scene, whether
viewed in prospect or in retrospect. Still we rolled along (ah!
far too swiftly! and often did I wish that I were a youthful
traveller on foot), still we rolled along, meeting the flowing
River, smooth as glass, yet so rapid that the stream of motion
is always perceptible, even from a great distance. The riches
of this region are not easily fancied,&mdash;the pretty paths, the
gardens among plots of vineyard and corn, cottages peeping
from the shade, villages and spires, in never-ending variety."

<p>This song was set to music by Mr. Carnaby in 1802.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>"26th July.&mdash;Reached Heidelberg.... We walked a while about the
garden and ruins of the Castle. Looked down upon the grey-roofed Town,
with its Cathedral running parallel with the river Neckar, over which, by a
fine bridge, we had crossed on entering; boats shooting curiously over the
rapids; vines, hanging gardens climbing up the hill, clothing the rocks, and
creeping into their crevices, on every side of us, and up to the very point
where we stood. The Town, with its squares and fountains, its narrow
long streets, with arched gateways, towers, and spires, courts, and quaint
flower gardens, fill the deep valley. The river disappears, winding away
among the hills to the right. Before us it holds a direct course&mdash;through a
widening tract of the same prolific country&mdash;to the Rhine, seen in the
distance.... 27th... The passage through the bridge being somewhat
dangerous, those who accompany the rafts, as they approach, fall down
upon their knees to pray, then raise their voices and sing an appropriate
anthem till the peril is past." (Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.)</p>

<p>"Friday, 28th July. Heidelberg.&mdash;The River flows beside it calmly
(though with strong motion as all these large rivers do), but after that point,
to the Bridge, the channel is rocky, and therefore the stream turbulent.
While passing under the garden-wall, the peasant sailor, before he trusts his
boat or timber-raft to the rocks and rapids, kneels down and prays for protection
from danger, and a safe passage through the arches of the Bridge.
An Image of Jesus on the cross is the visible object of his worship, which
Mr. Pickford, when he rebuilt his garden-wall, replaced in its station, out of
respect to the piety or superstition of past and present times. During the
passage an appropriate hymn is chaunted&mdash;the thought touched our poet's
fancy, and he has since composed the following verses for the Heidelberg
boatmen." (From Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal, vol. i.)</p>

<p>In the edition of 1822 a sonnet followed this Hymn, entitled <cite>The Jung-Frau&mdash;and
the Rhine at Shauffhausen</cite>. In the edition of 1827 it was transferred
to the series of "Ecclesiastical Sonnets," under the title of its first
line, "Down a swift Stream, thus far, a bold design," which place it retained
in all subsequent editions (see Part III. No. xii.) The following note
accompanied the sonnet in the edition of 1822:&mdash;"This Sonnet belongs to
another publication, but from its fitness for this place is inserted here also.</p>

<p>'Voilà un énfer d'eau,' cried out a German Friend of Ramond, falling on his
knees on the scaffold in front of this Waterfall. See Ramond's Translation
of Coxe."&mdash;W. W.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

  <div class="i0"><em>Not (like his great Compeers) indignantly</em></div>
  <div class="i0"><em>Doth Danube spring to light!</em></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Before this quarter of the Black Forest was inhabited, the
source of the Danube might have suggested some of those
sublime images which Armstrong has so finely described; at
present the contrast is most striking. The Spring appears in a
capacious Stone Basin upon the front of a Ducal palace, with a
pleasure-ground opposite; then, passing under the pavement,
takes the form of a little, clear, bright, black, vigorous rill,
barely wide enough to tempt the agility of a child five years old
to leap over it,&mdash;and, entering the Garden, it joins, after a
course of a few hundred yards, a Stream much more considerable
than itself. The <em>copiousness</em> of the Spring at <em>Doneschingen</em>
must have procured for it the honour of being named the
Source of the Danube.&mdash;W. W. 1822.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>"Monday, 31st July.&mdash;... We drew towards the town of
Villingen, a foreign-looking place standing in the descent, and
lifting up its metallic dome-like spires, without the accompaniment
of a single tree.... The Church with its two-fold spire
glittered in the hot sunshine, like pewter in a melting state.
Our guide had told us that near this place the Danube took its
rise; but not so.... At <em>Doneschingen</em> changed horses
again. <em>Here</em> we laved in the water which flowed from the
source of the majestic Danube, a little, clear, bright, black rill,
that issuing from a capacious stone fountain, into which it
springs, crosses the road, and glides rapidly along the side of
a beautiful pleasure-ground.... We washed, drank, and
luxuriated in the cool and pure waters of this rill, unwilling to
quit what we were not again to see&mdash;a reality very different
from the stately Danube, so long an image to the imagination."
(Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.)</p>

<p>"Tuesday, 1st August. Villingen.&mdash;The landlord seemed
to entertain high ideas of this his native place&mdash;its modern
improvements in gardens and its former grandeur&mdash;and told us
that one of his servants should conduct us to the palace, the
gardens, the baths, and last of all, though most the object of
our curiosity, to the source of the <span class="smcap">Danube</span>....</p>

<p>"But I seem to have forgotten the source of the Danube,
which truly <em>was 'another'</em><a name="FNanchor_HL_714" id="FNanchor_HL_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_HL_714" class="fnanchor">[HL]</a> Danube after we had seen it; or,
more properly speaking, after we had seen the moor-land
country surrounding the Town of Doneschingen, where we
knew we should meet with the source of that famous river;
and it is not only <em>there</em> (in that Hollow wild without grandeur),
but actually within the walls of the Duke's courts adjoining the
trim flower garden. The bountiful spring is received by a
large square stone basin, and thence flows through the gardens
in a narrow stream like a vigorous mill-race. Had an active
boy been by our side he would have over-leapt it. That
streamlet, after the course of a few hundred yards, falls into the
bed of the united rivers the P&mdash;&mdash; and the P&mdash;&mdash; which take
their rise in the <em>moorish</em> hills seen on the right in the road from
Villingen, and which we looked upon from the gardens at the
same time that we saw the new-born streamlet (called the
source of the Danube) gush into their channel. I suppose it
must be the remarkable strength of the spring which has caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
it to be dignified with its title; for certainly those other two
streams (united a little above the gardens) are the primary
sources (of this branch at least) of the Danube." (From
Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal, vol. i.)</p>

<p>What Dorothy Wordsworth mentions in reference to the
Danube occurs in many other rivers; <em>e.g.</em> the source of the
Clyde, in Scotland, is a tiny burn in Lanarkshire, which, after
a short moorland course, falls (near Elvanfoot) into the large
stream of the Daur&mdash;the latter having come down for many
miles from the Lead Hills district. The P&mdash;&mdash; and P&mdash;&mdash; is
probably a mistake for B&mdash;&mdash; and B&mdash;&mdash;. The mountain
torrent of the Bregé in the Schwartzwald is joined by the
Bregach, and when the stream receives the waters from the
spring in the Castle Garden of Doneschingen it becomes the
Danube.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>The Staubbach is a narrow Stream, which, after a long
course on the heights, comes to the sharp edge of a somewhat
overhanging precipice, overleaps it with a bound, and, after a
fall of 930 feet, forms again a rivulet. The vocal powers of
these musical Beggars may seem to be exaggerated; but this
wild and savage air was utterly unlike any sounds I had ever
heard; the notes reached me from a distance, and on what
occasion they were sung I could not guess, only they seemed to
belong, in some way or other, to the Waterfall&mdash;and reminded
me of religious services chaunted to Streams and Fountains in
Pagan times.&mdash;W. W. 1822. Mr. Southey has thus accurately
characterised the peculiarity of this music: "While we were at
the Waterfall, some half-score peasants, chiefly women and girls,
assembled just out of reach of the Spring, and set up&mdash;surely,
the wildest chorus that ever was heard by human ears,&mdash;a song
not of articulate sounds, but in which the voice was used as a
mere instrument of music, more flexible than any which art
could produce,&mdash;sweet, powerful, and thrilling beyond description."
(See Notes to <cite>A Tale of Paraguay</cite>.)&mdash;W. W. 1837.</p>

<p>"Thursday, 10th Aug....&mdash;Walked to the Staubbach, the
thin veil-like mist-besprinkled waterfall, that slips over the edge
of an immensely high perpendicular rock&mdash;which, when we saw
it by the morning light, was accompanied by a beautiful rainbow;
spanning, like the arch of a bridge, the vapour at the
base of the rock. Singing Girls. But I must not neglect to
speak of the beauty of the <em>early</em> morning, in the magnificent
pass between Interlachen and Lauterbrunnen. The river from
Jungfrau bounding down with great force, bringing a very cold
air from the snowy regions. Cottages with their green summer
plots climbing up in all directions, to the very skirts of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
icy regions. Two that looked so beautiful in the sunshine.
Women and children busy with their little lot of hay. Men
mowing." (Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.)</p>

<p>"Thursday, 10th August. Interlachen.&mdash;The Staubbach is
a narrow stream, which, after a long course on the heights,
comes to the sharp edge of a somewhat overhanging precipice,
overleaps it with a bound, and, after a fall of 930 feet, forms
again a rivulet, that passing through a green sloping pasture
crosses the road, and thence through the heaving grounds, takes
its clear waters to the grey torrent of the Leutshen. When
tracking with my young guide the rivulet to its momentary
resting-place, a small basin at the foot of the cataract, two
women appeared before me singing a shrill and savage air; the
tones were startling, and in connection with their wild yet quiet
figures strangely combined with the sounds of dashing water
and the silent aspect of the huge crag that seemed to reach the
sky! The morning sun falling on this side of the valley, a
circular rainbow was seen when we were there, between the
Fall and the Rock, the space being several yards, and you stand
within that space in a bath of dew. I was close to the women
when they began to sing, and hence, probably, it was that I
perceived nothing of <em>sweetness</em> in their tones. I cannot answer
for the impression on the rest of the party except my brother,
who being behind, heard the carol from a distance; and the
description he gives of it is similar to Mr. Southey's in his
Journal." (From Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal, vol. i.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>"Saturday, Aug. 12.&mdash;It is now half-past twelve o'clock,
and I am sitting upon a sort of myrtle bed under a pine grove
among the rocks, down which the headlong Aar cleaves its way,
having dined in the cabin at Handeck, in close neighbourhood
with our steeds. All that we have hitherto seen seemed at the
moment but a faint preparation for the delights of this day.
The beautiful valley we left behind us, the groves, the forest of
oak and pine, the glades, the one particularly in which we met
that 'Hoifer,' as we called him, with his heron's crest proudly
reared upon his head, a little page carrying his accoutrements.
He with many others, but none like this Hero, there was repairing
to shoot for a prize at Meyringen. Then, those lovely
vales, that circular one, the pride of them all, which led us to
the savage Pass and giant Pines, where lurks this King of
Waterfalls. What delicious couches to rest upon. Here to
linger out a long summer's day would be a luxury. A more
sober passage home&mdash;our spirits a little, but very little, damped
by the stretch of enjoyment." (Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.)</p>

<p>"Saturday, 12th August. Meyringen.&mdash;Crossed the stream,
and <em>re</em>-crossed it, and from a stony hollow, uninhabited, came
into the gloom of a pine forest, which led us, by a steep ascent,
to the rocks surrounding the Fall of the Aar. Long before our
approach, we heard the roaring, while that sound was deadened
by the intermediate rocks and trees; but when standing on a
bank, in front of the cataract, I could have believed at the first
moment, that it was louder even than that of the Rhine at
Schaffhausen. This impression, no doubt, was owing chiefly
to its being confined within a narrow space. The pine-clad
precipices, especially on the opposite side, are very lofty, rising
from the rocks of the Pass, kept bare by continual wetting.
The gloom of the forest-mountains, in harmony with the
sombrous hue of the water, would, of itself, make this first view
of this cataract much more impressive than that of the Reichenbach;
but again we looked in vain&mdash;not for delicate passages
in the stream;&mdash;those could not be thought of;&mdash;but for some
of those minute graces, and those overgrowings that detain us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
in admiration beside our own pellucid waterfalls.<a name="FNanchor_HN_721" id="FNanchor_HN_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_HN_721" class="fnanchor">[HN]</a> There is a
grey furnace-like smoke of water, and a desperate motion and
ferment, that make the head dizzy and stun the ears." ...
"We clambered upon other rocks; and, at leisure, noticed the
variety of shrubby plants and flowers, which here (being higher
than the stream) grew securely, nursed by perpetual dews.
Luxuriant tufts of a very large sedum were lodged on the ledges,
or hung from dark crevices; those tufts, in form and motion,
as they waved and fluttered in the breeze of the cataract, resembling
the plumes of a hearse, were an ornament well suited
to the pine-clad steeps, and the heavenly beauty of the rainbow."

<p>"Aug. 7th. We reached this place, Thun. Walked or
sate in the groves at the foot of the Lake, then crossed the river
by a boat, and wandered in delightful pleasure groves on the
other side. Then, passing a gravelled path, which is carried
round the woody hill, we found among many interesting objects,
one that was very impressive, a plain oval slab, raised upon a
stone seat, directly fronting the setting sun, which at that
moment was shedding his latest rays upon it. It was this
inscription which spoke more than an elaborate panegyric:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><em>DEM<br />

<p>(Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.)</p>

<p>"Monday, 7th August. Berne.&mdash;One of the inscriptions
(which I did not see) was to the memory of Aloys Reding, a
Friend of the possessor of these grounds. A happy chance led
my Companions to the spot; and here is the inscription copied
by one of them:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><em>DEM<br />

<p>It will be observed from the dates given in the Journals,
that the poet did not keep to the chronological order of the

<p>occur both in Mrs. Wordsworth's and in Dorothy's Journal.
<em>E.g.</em> (Crossing the St. Gotthard Pass) "Aug. 24.&mdash;... Gained
the top by a steep pull; snow before and behind; a crucifix,
and oratories thicken upon our course as we draw near to the
Hospice. 'Gales from Italy' blow fresh around. Snow on the
roadside. Farther on a little cross under a rock.... We
yesterday noticed five of these crosses, two placed under one
rock, and three under another." "Aug. 15. (Engelberg.)&mdash;...
Counted the wayside upright oratories; found no less than
sixteen before we reached the house, where we resumed our
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">char-à-bancs</i>." "Aug. 8. (At Interlachen.)&mdash;... The view
that takes in the length of the Vale, following the snaky river
with its islands, through those croft-like, woody, orchard
meadows to Unterseen, with its weir, church, bridges, cottages,
and that spiral edifice in the midst: Lake of Thun beyond, girt
by mountains: Neissen, a pyramidal giant, predominant.
Turning to the left towards Brientz, Ringenberg old Church
tower rising from a high woody knoll. William and I came to
it. (I write on the spot. Wm. asleep.) No entrance into the
ruin, good view of Brientz Lake, and a little Loughrigg Tarn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
above, close under where we are seated among groves of limes,
hazels, beeches, etc.; clanking hammers, singing girl. 'Will
no one tell me what she sings?'<a name="FNanchor_HP_728" id="FNanchor_HP_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_HP_728" class="fnanchor">[HP]</a> A little further on, among
those sylvan crofts, a scattered group of day or summer-deserted
cabins; plots of hemp spread in the sunshine tell us dwellers
sometimes come here. Hence steps of rock led us to a temple
of Nature's own framing, roofed with ancient beech trees.
Under one was firmly fixed in the ground a little upright stone,
about a span in width, and three times that length. Upon it
was roughly chisled a cross, not exactly a Christ-cross, but
something like this.... I could not but feel that it might
have been placed there by the Peasants, as a point to meet from
their scattered sheds for worship. Natural seats, mossy or bare,
like those in our own sylvan parlour (upon Rydal Lake), all
around in the rocks, kept up the idea; and a more lovely and
silent spot could not have been selected for a holy purpose: the
little Tarn too in sight, in time of drought, ready to supply their
rocky font with fresh water."</p>

<p>"Friday, 14th September. Martigny.&mdash;Passing the turn of
the ascent, we come to another Cross, (placed there to face the
Traveller ascending from the other side), and, from the brow of
the eminence, behold! to our left, the huge Form of Mont
Blanc&mdash;pikes, towers, needles, and wide wastes of everlasting
snow in dazzling brightness. Below is the river Arve, a grey-white
line, winding to the village of Chamouny, dimly seen in
the distance. Our station, though on a height so commanding,
was on the lowest point of the eminence; and such as I have
sketched (but how imperfectly!) was the scene uplifted and
outspread before us. The higher parts of the mountain in our
neighbourhood are sprinkled with brown Chalets. So they were
thirty years ago, as my Brother well remembered; and he
pointed out to us the very quarter from which a Boy greeted
him and his companion with an Alpine cry&mdash;</p>

to a promontory, whence he hoped to see the termination of the
lake, and thither he is gone to look out for the Boat, our friends
being upon the water. I am left to rest under the shade of
some beeches. A fine walk we have had; bold immensely
high limestone rocks above my head, grey hoary steeps, magnificent
walnut trees, the favourite of the country; Swiss figures
gliding among the trees, with their deep bright baskets on their
backs; pines climbing up to the sky, fringing the rocks; scarlet
barberries glittering, and tipping the pendent boughs of the
beech or walnut trees below," etc. etc.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, 9th August. Interlachen.&mdash;Our minstrel
peasants passed us on the water, no longer singing <em>plaintive</em>
ditties such as inspired the little poem, which I shall transcribe
in the following page; but with bursts of merriment they rowed
lustily away. The poet has, however, transported the minstrels
in their gentle mood from the Cottage door to the calm Lake."

<p>Engelberg, the Hill of Angels, as the name implies. The
Convent whose site was pointed out, according to tradition, in
this manner, is seated at its base. The Architecture of the
Building is unimpressive, but the situation is worthy of the
honour which the imagination of the Mountaineers has conferred
upon it.&mdash;W. W. 1822.</p>

<p>"Monday, August 14.&mdash;At sunset we reached the edge of
the flat green area, sublimely guarded; from its head rose
Engelberg (whence the angels sang), Tittlesberg,<a name="FNanchor_HS_733" id="FNanchor_HS_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_HS_733" class="fnanchor">[HS]</a> the highest
of these Alps. But between these two stood another more
fantastically shaped rocky hill with a broken jagged crest, and
without snow.... All around the Vale is completely enclosed
by lofty barriers, piercing or supporting the clouds.
From the eminence whence we first had a sight of the mists
curling in the glowing sun upon the heights of Engelberg, the
white convent with its own, and its lesser attendant chapels;
the pensive moving figures, in their gay attire, that as we
approached saluted us; and before we gained our harbour for
the night, the convent bell calling to vespers, seemed to summon
my ears to listen for the angels' voices from that celestial mount.
All these impressions could not but excite in us thankfulness
that we had been led to this Abyssinian Vale (as D. appropriately
termed it)." (Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>"Monday, 14th August. Sarnen.&mdash;It was a little past
seven o'clock when (having passed round the neck of the hill,
or promontory, as I may call it) we perceived that the object
of our delightful day's journey could not be far distant. A
stately mass of crag, a mountain composed of stone of a soft
yellow hue irregularly piled up, and between pyramid and
tower-shaped, appeared before us. It could be no other than
the Hill of <em>Engelberg</em>, the Angel's Hill, where, it is believed,
the angels sang songs of approval, while holy men laid the
foundation of the abbey. Others say that the Founders were
led to <em>choose</em> that spot because the Rock of Engelberg was the
place those happy spirits were accustomed to haunt, and that
their melodies were heard while the work was going on. It is
no wonder that such traditions are believed by some of the good
Catholics even at this day; for never was there on earth a more
beautiful pinnacle for happy spirits than the Rock of Engelberg,
as we first beheld it, gilded with the beams of the declining sun.
Light clouds, as white as snow, yet melting into the thinnest
substance, and tinged with heavenly light, were floating around
and below its summit. We exclaimed, 'There you see the
wings of the Angels!'&mdash;&mdash;. Our recollections of that moment
cannot be effaced; and some time afterwards my Brother expressed
his feelings in the following little Poem." (From
Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal, vol. i.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>"August, Saturday 19th. Top of the Rigi.&mdash;... Eastern
sky rich with golden streaks, clouds floating around in all
directions <em>below us</em>: then driving eastwards, we expecting
momently to be enveloped in the condensing mist, but the
breezes again and again took it away, through the channel
between the Rigi and the opposite mountains. At length the
bright sun just showed itself, lighted up the tips of the Alps
with a rosy splendour, silvered the edges of, and gave angels'
wings to the neighbouring clouds for a moment, then shrouded
himself up, and the glory faded away.... A tall cross is
finely placed upon the top of this hill.... Set forward on
our descent from this remarkable place. Pleasant green
mountain track led us soon to the Parish Church of Rigiberg,
dedicated to 'Our Lady of the Snow.' It was crammed with
pictures of the Virgin and Child, in various situations, setting
forth her miraculous powers, and how they had been exercised:
small convent of Capuchins close by: easy and beautiful road
down for some time; high Crosses with pictures all the way;
Chapels with frightful figures, enough to terrify the Religious
on their way to 'Our Lady of the Snow': met several peasants
before we reached the foot of the hill; Houses for them to rest
on their way: beautiful <em>steep thin</em> waterfalls; lofty wooded and
pine-clad crags accompanied us all the way on our descent...."
(From Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.)</p>

<p>"Saturday, 19th August. Top of Rigi.&mdash;With hearts not
less joyous than those of the young men with whom we had
just parted, we began our journey. How delicious was the
descent over the velvet turf, towards the Chapel of Our Lady
of the Snow! seen below within a narrow steep glen. The
air still fresh and cool, we gradually find ourselves enclosed by
the declivities of the glen, those rugged steeps are hung with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
pine trees, narrow cataracts come down the clefts in unbroken
white lines&mdash;or over the facings of rock, in drops and stages.
Side by side with the central rivulet, we go on still descending,
though with far slower pace, and come to the Village of Rigi,
and our Lady's Chapel cradled in the slip of the dell, and, at
this tranquil time, <em>lulled</em> by the voices of the streams. The
interior of the Chapel is hung with hundreds of offerings&mdash;staffs,
crutches, etc. etc., and pictures representing marvellous escapes,
with written records of vows performed&mdash;and dangers averted
through the gracious protection of Our Lady of the Snow.
Near the Chapel is a small religious House, where a few Monks
reside, probably in attendance upon the chapel, which continues
to draw together numerous worshippers from the distant Vales
on days of penitence or of festival." (From Dorothy Wordsworth's
Journal, vol. i.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>In Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal the following occurs, under
date August 21.&mdash;"Altorf.... Visited a Painter, who
follows his Art, and instructs pupils in 'Tell's Tower': fine
prospect from the Tower, and from the Church beautiful almost
beyond description. The towers of Altorf, the Vale beyond,
and Fluellin on the margin of the lake; the pine-clad barriers,
with here and there a fantastic marked rock, or a snowy forehead
reared above all.... I have called this place a village,
but I insult the capital of the canton of Uri by so doing:
neither <em>is it like a village</em>. A small Town, with stately houses,
Fountains&mdash;Tell's Fountain, Church, a large Painted Tower,
that gives Tell's story, is built upon the very spot where the
famous Tree grew. The tree is there represented, and under
it the pretty little boy with the apple upon his head...."</p>

<p class="p3">"Monday, 20th August. Altorf.&mdash;We found our own
comfortable Inn, <span class="smcap">The Ox</span>, near the fountain of William Tell.
The buildings here are fortunately disposed with a pleasing
irregularity. Opposite to our Inn stands the Tower of the
Arsenal, built upon the spot where grew the Linden-tree to
which Tell's son is reported to have been bound when the
arrow was shot. This Tower was spared by the fire which
consumed an adjoining building, <em>happily</em> spared, if only for the
sake of the rude paintings on its walls. I studied them with
infinite satisfaction, especially the face of the innocent little
Boy with the apple on his head. After dinner we walked up
the valley to the reputed birthplace of Tell: it is a small
village at the foot of a glen, rich, yet very wild. A rude unroofed
modern bridge crosses the boisterous river, and, beside
the bridge is a fantastic mill-race, constructed in the same
rustic style&mdash;uncramped by apprehensions of committing waste
upon the woods. At the top of a steep rising directly from the
river, stands a square tower of grey stone, partly covered with
ivy, in itself rather a striking object from the bridge, even if
not pointed out for notice as being built on the site of the
dwelling where William Tell was born. Near it, upon the
same eminence, stands the white church, and a small chapel
called by Tell's name, where we again found rough paintings
of his exploits, mixed with symbols of the Roman Catholic
faith. Our walk from Altorf to this romantic spot had been
stifling; along a narrow road between old stone walls&mdash;nothing
to be seen above them but the tops of fruit trees, and the
imprisoning hills. No doubt when those walls were built, the
lands belonged to the churches and monasteries. Happy were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
we when we came to the glen and rushing river, and still
happier when, having clomb the eminence, we sate beside the
churchyard, where kindly breezes visited us&mdash;the warm breezes
of Italy! We had here a Volunteer guide, a ragged child,
voluble with his story, trimmed up for the stranger. He
could tell the history of the Hero of Uri, and declare the
import of each memorial;&mdash;while (not neglecting the saints) he
proudly pointed out to our notice (what indeed could not have
escaped it) a gigantic daubing of the figure of St. Christopher
on the wall of the church steeple. But our smart young
maiden was to introduce us to the interior of the ivied Tower,
so romantic in its situation above the roaring stream, at the
mouth of the glen, which, behind, is buried beneath overhanging
woods. We ascended to the upper rooms by a blind staircase,
that might have belonged to a turret of one of our ancient
castles, which conducted us into a gothic room, where we
found neither the ghost nor the armour of William Tell; but
an artist at work with the pencil; with two or three young
men, his pupils, from Altorf&mdash;no better introduction to the
favour of one of those young men was required than that of our
sprightly female attendant. From this little academy of the
arts, drawings are dispersed, probably, to every country of the
continent of Europe." (From Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal,
vol. ii.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

 </div>
</div>

<p>"Seewen, Sunday, 20th August.&mdash;... Wm. and I walked
the direct way to Brunnen; the rest, viz. Mr. R., T. M., and
Dorothy, by way of Schwytz. Our course lay along the brook
that runs through, and I believe gives its name to the village of
Seewen; that by Schwytz forms two sides of the triangle, and
carried them considerably above us on our left. We had a fine
view all the way of the town of Schwytz, which is beautifully
situated, and looked stately under its protecting screen of
mountains, green and woody to the very top. They bend
around and tower above it; one rising higher than the rest, in
the very centre of the crescent, and directly above the church
spire, has a fine effect. I was sorry to pass without going into
this important tower, which gives its name to the delightful
country of which it is the capital, and its <em>station</em> is well worthy
of that honour. The <em>pastoral sylvan</em> character of Switzerland
is happily exemplified here, and the mountains and lakes lead
you gently into the more solemn and awful scenes. <em>Our</em> path
led us through soft verdant meadows, where we met and were
overtaken by the peasants with their books and nosegays in
their hands...." (From Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.)</p>

<p class="p5">"Sunday, 20th August. Sieven.&mdash;... If Berne, with
its spacious survey of Alps, and widely-spreading Vales, and
magnificent River, may be called the <em>head</em>, this Town [Schwytz],
intrenched among mountains, may be called the <em>heart</em> of
Switzerland; to which the Canton is worthy of giving its
name. Of records or curiosities that may be shut up from
view, I know nothing; but in our half hour's sauntering through
the town, we were in a state of perpetual excitement&mdash;not that
there is anything beautiful, or even picturesque, in the Buildings,
but altogether something romantic&mdash;with gaiety....</p>

<p>"Our way was down the Vale, toward the Lake Waldstädte,<a name="FNanchor_HY_747" id="FNanchor_HY_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_HY_747" class="fnanchor">[HY]</a>
nearly at right angles to that by which we had come to Schwytz.
We asked who were the owners of a handsome large house, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
our right hand, and were told a Family of the name of Reding.
There was no one to tell us whether it was the Birth-place, or
had been the residence of Aloys Reding; but have since had
the satisfaction of learning from my Friend, Mr. Rogers, that it
<em>was</em>, and that he had seen him there: but I will copy Mr. R.'s
own words from a letter written by him to me some years ago.<a name="FNanchor_HZ_750" id="FNanchor_HZ_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_HZ_750" class="fnanchor">[HZ]</a></p>

<p>"'When at Schwytz in 1802, we paid him a visit, and at
the gate were surprised by a little girl coming from school, who
first took my hand, and then my sister's&mdash;leading her upstairs,
and supporting her by the elbow, into a large old-fashioned
room, where we found him drinking coffee with his Family,
after dinner, the clock striking two. There was a noble
simplicity in his manners, and a courtesy, a cordiality in the
reception they all gave us that sent us away enchanted.'</p>

<p>"Leaving the high-road, we turned along one of those pretty
paths that look as if they were only made for going to Church,
and for Fetes and Festivals. Numerous were the companies
who passed, or followed us on this path, through spacious,
level, and mostly <em>verdant</em> fields&mdash;mountains on all sides, with
craggy summits. Behind us was the Town of Schwytz at the
foot of the forest steep, overtopped by the two naked Pikes;
and to our left what sublime dark clefts!" (From Dorothy
Wordsworth's Journal, vol. i.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

</div>

<p>"Thursday, Aug. 24.&mdash;... On the banks of the infant
Ticino, which has its source in the pools above, within a few
hundred yards of that which gives birth to the Reuss, D. and I
resolved to reject all political boundaries, and thenceforth consider
ourselves in <em>Italy</em>. With the pure stream we descended;
but first were joined by Mr. R., J. M., and Wm., with a young
German, whom Mr. R. had picked up in the morning; a
Heidelberg student, travelling on foot to Rome. He sang and
played to us upon the flute, airs from Rossini, the Swiss Cow
Song, etc. Then on we went, wending our way over the grass
between the paved road and the brook wherever we could. The
Brook dashing down its stony channel, now over rocks, now
under shelving snow, and its banks seen clothed with underwood
and pines. Passed by its first wooden bridge, leading to the
cottages, not unmindful of <cite>our own Duddon</cite>; and presently did
it grace such an assemblage of rocks, dells, and woods, forming
waterfalls, pools, and all the various charms that a mountain
stream can show." (Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.)</p>

<p>"Thursday, 23rd August. Hopital.&mdash;I found Mary sitting
on the lowest of a long flight of steps. She had lost her
companions (my Brother and a young Swiss who had joined us on
the road). We mounted the steps, and, from within, their
voices answered our call. Went along a dark, stone, <em>banditti</em>
passage, into a small chamber little less gloomy, where we found
them seated with food before them, bread and cheese, with sour
red wine&mdash;no milk. Hunger satisfied, Mary and I hastened to
warm ourselves in the sunshine; for the house was as cold as a
dungeon. We straightway greeted with joy the infant <span class="smcap">Ticino</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
which has its sources in the pools above. The gentlemen joined
us, and we placed ourselves on a sunny bank, looking towards
Italy; and the Swiss took out his flute, and played, and afterwards
sang, the <cite>Ranz des Vaches</cite>, and other airs of his country.
We, and especially our sociable friend R. (with his inexhaustible
stock of kindness, and his German tongue) found him a pleasant
companion. He was from the University of Heidelberg, and
bound for Rome, on a visit to a Brother, in the holidays; and,
our mode of travelling, for a short way, being the same, it was
agreed we should go on together: but before we reached Airola
he left us, and we saw no more of him." (From Dorothy

FORT FUENTES<a name="FNanchor_516_751" id="FNanchor_516_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_751" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></h3>

<p>The Ruins of Fort Fuentes form the crest of a rocky eminence
that rises from the plain at the head of the Lake of Como,
commanding views up the Valteline, and toward the town of
Chiavenna. The prospect in the latter direction is characterised
by melancholy sublimity. We rejoiced at being favoured with
a distinct view of those Alpine heights; not, as we had expected
from the breaking up of the storm, steeped in celestial glory,
yet in communion with clouds floating or stationary&mdash;scatterings
from heaven. The Ruin is interesting both in mass and in
detail. An Inscription, upon elaborately-sculptured marble
lying on the ground, records that the Fort had been erected by
Count Fuentes in the year 1600, during the reign of Philip the
Third; and the Chapel, about twenty years after, by one of his
Descendants. Marble pillars of gateways are yet standing, and
a considerable part of the Chapel walls: a smooth green turf
has taken place of the pavement, and we could see no trace of
altar or image; but every where something to remind one of
former splendour, and of devastation and tumult. In our ascent
we had passed abundance of wild vines intermingled with
bushes: near the ruins were some ill tended, but growing
willingly; and rock, turf, and fragments of the pile, are alike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
covered or adorned with a variety of flowers, among which the
rose-coloured pink was growing in great beauty. While descending,
we discovered on the ground, apart from the path,
and at a considerable distance from the ruined Chapel, a statue
of a Child in pure white marble, uninjured by the explosion
that had driven it so far down the hill. "How little," we exclaimed,
"are these things valued here! Could we but transport
this pretty Image to our own garden!"&mdash;Yet it seemed it
would have been a pity any one should remove it from its couch
in the wilderness, which may be its own for hundreds of years.

</div>

<p>"Wed., Sept. 6.&mdash;... Crossed the plain of Colico to
<span class="smcap">Fuentes</span>, a ruined Fort on the summit of a group of Rocks,
abruptly rising from the plain, and overlooking the head of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
Lake towards Chiavenna; up the nearer and larger valley,
whence comes the Adda, a river bearing the same name as that
which flows out of the Lake at Lecco; and into the clefts and
recesses among the savage Rocks; over the plain; upon the
Lake. Wm. had gone on before D. and myself, and had gained
the top of this picturesque eminence, by a rough and difficult
way. <em>We</em> had determined to be satisfied with what we had
seen below, when two civil peasants joined us, and kindly led
us by an easy path to Wm. on the summit. He pointed out to
us where he had been lost, and separated from Jones; we were
enchanted by the mountain scenery. The whole spot excited
the deepest interest; and, from the very point where we were,
this rocky station, with its ruined fort, church, dwellings, all
desolated by those barbarians the French, it was very affecting
to see vines&mdash;which no doubt had heretofore been carefully
supported by trellises upon these terraces&mdash;now running wild,
and gadding about among the underwood that clothed the
banks. Lumps and masses of marble&mdash;architectural ravages&mdash;strewn
about. Apart from the path, and at a considerable
distance from the grassy glade where the church had stood, lay
the beautiful statue of a Child, in pure white marble. It seemed
strange that this had not been removed; yet scarcely less strange
than that, among the grass should be left an inscription upon
marble, together with richly carved ornaments, expressing that
the Fort had been erected by a Spanish Count Fuentes, in the
time of Philip the third...." (Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.)</p>

<p>"Wednesday, 5th September. Cadenabbia.&mdash;Bent our
course toward Fuentes&mdash;and after a wearisome walk through
damp and breathless heat (a full league or more) over a perfect
level, we reached the foot of the eminence, which from the lake
had appeared to be at a small distance, but it seemed to have
retreated as we advanced. We had left the high road, and
trudged over the swampy plain, through which the road must
have been made with great expense and labour, as it is raised
considerably all the way. The picturesque ruins of the Castle
of Fuentes are at the top of the eminence&mdash;wild vines, the
bramble and the clematis cling to the bushes; and beautiful
flowers grow in the chinks of the rocks, and on every bed of
grass. A <em>tempting</em> though rugged ascent&mdash;yet (with the towers
in sight above our heads, and two-thirds of the labour accomplished)
Mary and I (Wm. having gone before to discover the
nearest and least difficult way for us) sate down determined not
to go a step further. We had a grand prospect; and, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
exhausted by the damp heat, were willing for once to leave our
final object unattained. However, while seated on the ground,
two stout hard-laboured peasants chancing to come close to us
on the path, invited us forward, and we could not resist&mdash;they
led the way&mdash;two rough creatures.</p>

<p>"I said to Mary when we were climbing up among the rocks
and bushes in that wild and lonely place, 'What, you have no
fear of trusting yourself to a pair of Italian Banditti?' I knew
not their occupation, but an accurate description of their persons
would have fitted a novel-writer with ready-made attendants
for a tribe of robbers&mdash;good-natured and kind, however they
were, nay, even polite in their rustic way as others tutored to
city civility. <em>Cultivated</em> vines grew upon the top of the hill;
and they took pains to pluck for us the ripest grapes. We now
had a complete view up the great vale of the Adda, to which,
the road that we had left conducts the Traveller. Below us,
on the other side, lay a wide green marshy plain, between the
hill of Fuentes and the shores of the lake; which plain, spreading
upwards, divides the lake; the upper small reach being
called Chiavenna. The path which my Brother had travelled,
when bewildered in the night thirty years ago, was traceable
through some parts of the forest on the opposite side:&mdash;and the
very passage through which he had gone down to the shore of
the lake&mdash;then most dismal with thunder, lightning, and rain.
I hardly can conceive a place of more solitary aspect than the
lake of Chiavenna: and the whole of the prospect on that
direction is characterized by melancholy sublimity. We rejoiced,
after our toil, at being favoured with a distinct view of
those sublime heights, not, it is true, steeped in celestial hues
of <em>sunny glory</em>, yet in communion with clouds, floating or
stationary:&mdash;scatterings from heaven. The Ruin itself is very
interesting, both in the mass and in detail&mdash;an inscription is
lying on the ground which records that the Castle was built by
the Count of Fuentes in the year 1600, and the Chapel about
twenty years after by one of his descendants. Some of the
gateways are yet standing with their marble pillars, and a considerable
part of the walls of the Chapel. A smooth green turf
has taken the place of the pavement; and we could see no
trace of altar or sacred image, but everywhere something to
remind one of former grandeur and of destruction and tumult,
while there was, in contrast with the imaginations so excited,
a melancholy pleasure in contemplating the wild quietness of
the present day. The vines, near the ruin, though ill tended,
grow willingly, and rock, turf, and fragments of the stately pile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
are alike covered or adorned with a variety of flowers, among
which the rose-coloured pink was in great beauty. In our
descent we found a fair white cherub, uninjured by the explosion
which had driven it a great way down the hill. It lay
bedded like an infant in its cradle among low green bushes.&mdash;W.
said to us, 'Could we but carry this pretty Image to our
moss summer-house at Rydal Mount!' yet it seemed as if it
would have been a pity that any one should remove it from its
couch in the wilderness, which may be its own for hundreds
of years." (From Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal, vol. ii.)</p>

<p>The "Extract from Journal," which Wordsworth prefixed to
this poem in the edition of 1827 and subsequent ones, is, it will
be observed, not an exact transcription from either of the two
Journals written by his wife and his sister. It is a compilation
from both of them; and, as it was doubtless written by
himself, it may illustrate the wish, expressed in the Fenwick
note to the poem <cite>Between Namur and Liege</cite>, that "some one
would put together the notices contained in these Journals,...
bringing the whole into a small compass," etc. Most readers
will be of opinion, however, that something has been lost by
the condensation, and that the poet's note of 1827 does not
render the publication of the longer extracts from the two
Journals superfluous. Another instance of Wordsworth's use
of the materials of these Journals, while rewriting the extract,
will be found in the note to the poem <cite>Brugès</cite>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

THE CHURCH OF SAN SALVADOR, SEEN
FROM THE LAKE OF LUGANO</h3>

<p>This Church was almost destroyed by lightning a few years
ago, but the Altar and the Image of the Patron Saint were untouched.
The Mount, upon the summit of which the Church
is built, stands in the midst of the intricacies of the Lake of
Lugano; and is, from a hundred points of view, its principal
ornament, rising to the height of 2000 feet, and, on one side,
nearly perpendicular. The ascent is toilsome; but the Traveller
who performs it will be amply rewarded. Splendid fertility,
rich woods and dazzling waters, seclusion and confinement of
view contrasted with sea-like extent of plain fading into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
sky; and this again, in an opposite quarter, with an horizon of
the loftiest and boldest Alps&mdash;unite in composing a prospect
more diversified by magnificence, beauty, and sublimity, than
perhaps any other point in Europe, of so inconsiderable an
elevation, commands.&mdash;W.W. 1822.</p>

<p>"Monday, 28th Aug. Lugano.&mdash;At half-past four o'clock,
wishing it had been earlier, we started to see the sun rise from
the top of San Salvador; found, at that dewy hour, the
Peasants busy in their vineyards, as we passed in our ascent.
Wm. and T.M. reached the top in an hour and twenty minutes.
Mr. R. kindly lingered with us. <em>We</em> ascended in about two
hours, and much were we delighted. The Alps how glorious!
The Rosa! the Simplon! and (as the guide told us) Mont
Blanc! and I believe he was right. However, Mont Blanc,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
nor no other mount, could surpass the exquisite appearance of
what belonged to earth, gleaming high up in the skies. This
was the glory of our view&mdash;the <em>majesty</em> lay to the left of these.
There, by the naked eye, we saw the River Po, drawn out in
silver line, along the horizon; and, with the telescope, towns
and villages gleaming on its banks. Mountains, glens, and
plains, the lake spreading at our feet this way and that, cutting
off the portion of land upon which this favoured and favouring
hill rises. A church and house upon the summit. Three years
ago the sacred edifice was struck by lightning, and every part of
it destroyed or greatly injured, except the altar. The holy place,
containing the image of San Salvador, was left untouched. In
that lofty chapel, now under repair, service is performed four
times a year; and at these festivals the same merriment goes
forward upon the mountain as in the villages and towns upon
like occasions. Offerings are then brought to the patron saint....
We returned highly delighted with this adventure, for
which we are indebted to Mr. R.'s Book, that determined us to
climb San Salvador, one of the grandest feats we have accomplished."
(Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.)</p>

<p>"Sunday, 26th August. Locarno.&mdash;We had resolved to
ascend St. Salvador before sunrise; and, a contrary wind
having sprung up, the Boatmen wished to persuade us to stay
all night at a town upon a low point of land pushed far into the
Lake, which conceals from our view that portion of it, where,
at the head of a large basin or bay, stands the town of Lugano.
They told us we might thence ascend the mountain with more
ease than from Lugano, a wile to induce us to stay; but we
called upon them to push on. Having weathered this point,
and left it some way behind, the place of our destination appears
in view&mdash;(like Locarno and Luvino) within the semicircle of a
bay&mdash;a wide basin of waters spread before it; and the reach of
the lake towards Porlezza winding away to our right. That
reach appeared to be of more grave and solemn character than
any we had passed through&mdash;grey steeps enclosing it on each
side. We now coasted beneath bare precipices at the foot of
St. Salvador&mdash;shouted to the echoes&mdash;and were answered by
travellers from the Road far above our heads. Thence tended
towards the middle of the basin; and the town of Lugano
appeared in front of us, low green woody hills rising above it.
Mild lightning fluttered like the northern lights over the steeps of
St. Salvador, yet without threatening clouds; the wind had
fallen; and no apprehensions of a storm disturbed our pleasures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
It was eight o'clock when we reached the inn, where all things
were on a large scale-splendid yet shabby."</p>

<p>"Monday, 27th August. Lugano.&mdash;Roused from sleep at
a quarter before four o'clock, the moon brightly shining. At a
quarter <em>past</em> four set off on foot to ascend Mount St. Salvador.
Though so early, people were stirring in the streets; our walk
was by the shore, round the fine bay&mdash;solemn yet cheerful in
the morning twilight. At the beginning of the ascent, passed
through gateways and sheds among picturesque old buildings
with overhanging flat roofs&mdash;vines hanging from the walls, with
the wildness of brambles or the untrained woodbine. The
ascent from the beginning is exceedingly steep and without
intermission to the very summit. Vines spreading from tree to
tree, resting upon walls, or clinging to wooden poles, they creep
up the steep sides of the hill, no boundary line between <em>them</em>
and the wild growth of the mountain, with which, at last, they
are blended till no trace of cultivation appears. The road is
narrow; but a path to the shrine of St. Salvador has been
made with great pains, still trodden once in the year by crowds
(probably, at this day, chiefly of peasantry) to keep the Festival
of that Saint on the summit of the mount. It winds along the
declivities of the rocks&mdash;and, all the way, the views are beautiful.
To begin with, looking backward to the town of Lugano,
surrounded by villas among trees&mdash;a rich vale beyond the Town,
an ample tract bright with cultivation and fertility, scattered
over with villages and spires&mdash;who could help pausing to look
back on these enchanting scenes? Yet a still more interesting
spectacle travels <em>with us</em>, at our side (but how far beneath us!)
the Lake, winding at the base of the mountain, into which we
looked from craggy forest precipices, apparently almost as steep
as the walls of a castle, and a thousand times higher. We were
bent on getting start of the rising sun, therefore none of the
party rested longer than was sufficient to recover breath. I did
so frequently, for a few minutes; it being my plan at all times
to climb up with my best speed for the sake of those rests,
whereas Mary, I believe, never once sate down this morning,
perseveringly mounting upward. Meanwhile, many a beautiful
flower was plucked among the mossy stones. One,<a name="FNanchor_IC_757" id="FNanchor_IC_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_IC_757" class="fnanchor">[IC]</a> in
particular, there was (since found wherever we have been in
Italy). I helped Miss Barker to plant that same flower in her
garden brought from Mr. Clarke's hot-house. In spite of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
our efforts the sun was beforehand with us. <em>We</em> were two
hours in ascending. W. and Mr. R. who had pushed on
before, were one hour and forty minutes. When we stood on
the crown of that glorious Mount, we seemed to have attained
a spot which commanded pleasures equal to all that sight could
give on this terrestrial world. We beheld the mountains of
Simplon&mdash;two brilliant shapes on a throne of clouds&mdash;<em>Mont
Blanc</em> (as the guide told us<a name="FNanchor_ID_758" id="FNanchor_ID_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_ID_758" class="fnanchor">[ID]</a>) lifting his resplendent forehead
above a vapoury sea&mdash;and the Monte Rosa, a bright pyramid,
how high up in the sky! The vision did not <em>burst</em> upon us
suddenly; but was revealed by slow degrees, while we felt so
satisfied and delighted with what lay distinctly outspread around
us, that we had hardly begun to look for objects less defined, in
the far-distant horizon. I cannot describe the green hollows,
hills, slopes, and woody plains&mdash;the towns, villages, and
towers&mdash;the crowds of secondary mountains, substantial in form
and outline, bounding the prospect in other quarters&mdash;nor the
bewitching loveliness of the lake of Lugano lying at the base of
Mount Salvador, and thence stretching out its arms between the
bold steeps. My brother said he had never in his life seen so
extensive a prospect at the expense only of two hours' climbing:
but it must be remembered that the whole of the ascent is
almost a precipice. Beyond the town of Lugano, the hills and
wide vale are thickly sprinkled with towns and houses. Small
lakes (to us their names unknown) were glittering among the
woody steeps, and beneath lay the broad neck of the Peninsula
of St. Salvador&mdash;a tract of hill and valley, woods and waters.
Far in the distance on the other side, the towers of Milan might
be descried. The river Po, a ghostly serpent-line, rested on
the brown plains of Lombardy; and there again we traced the
Ticino, departed from his mountain solitudes, where we had
been his happy companions.</p>

<p>"But I have yet only looked <em>beyond</em> the mount. There is
a house beside the Chapel, probably in former times inhabited
by persons devoted to religious services&mdash;or it might be only
destined for the same use for which it serves at present, a shelter
for them who flock from the vallies to the yearly Festival. Repairs
are going on in the Chapel, which was struck by lightning a few
years ago, and all but the altar and its holy things, with the
image of the patron saint, destroyed. Their preservation is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
established miracle, and the surrounding peasantry consider the
memorials as sanctified anew by that visitation from heaven."

the mountains, and casting silvery garments of all shapes over and
around them, now veiling and now unveiling the rocks, the Lake dancing
below. All that this Paradise had lost yesterday, restored and more than
restored. At about 7 o'clock, D. and I set forward to walk toward Menaggio.
Wm. soon overtook us, and we were joined by an interesting man, an inhabitant
of the neighbourhood, who walked by our side, and spoke in
commendation of our countrymen in opposition to his own, whom he did
not scruple to say had no honesty about them in their dealings with
Foreigners; nor, indeed, in bargaining with each other.... He spoke
English very well; had passed twenty years at different times in England,
in the course of twenty-five years; his journeys there cost him about three
guineas each time; had there realized <em>&pound;</em>2000, by selling telescopes and
weather glasses, etc.... Our travelling merchant joined us again, he
pointed out his farm with much glee." This extract does not seem very
relevant, but it is the only passage in Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal recording
an incident which <em>might</em> have given rise to <cite>The Italian Itinerant</cite>.</p>

<p>Dorothy Wordsworth gives the following fuller account of the same
person. "Thursday, 6th September. Cadenabbia.&mdash;After a night of heavy
rain, a bright morning. W., M., and I set off toward Menaggio along the
terrace bordering the water, which led us to the bay at the foot of the
rocky green hill of the Church of our Lady; and there we came upon the
track of the old road, the very <em>same</em> which my Brother had paced! for
there was no other, nor the possibility of one. That track, continued from
the foot of the mountain, leads behind the town of Cadenabbia, cutting off
the bending of the shore by which we had come to this point. From the
bare precipice, we pass through shade and sunshine, among spreading vines,
slips of green turf, or gardens of melons, gourds, maize, and fig-trees among
the rocks; it was but for a little space, yet enough to make our regret even
more lively than before that it had not been in our power to coast one
reach at least of the lake on foot. We had been overtaken by a fine tall
man, who somewhat proudly addressed us in English. After twenty years'
traffic in our country he had been settled near his native place on the
Banks of Como, having purchased an estate near Cadenabbia with the
large sum of two thousand pounds, acquired by selling barometers, looking-glasses,
etc. He had been used to return to his wife every third year in
the month of October. He made preparations during the winter for fresh
travels in the spring, at the same time working with her on the small
portion of land which they then possessed. Portsmouth and Plymouth were
the grand marts for his wares. He amused us with recitals of adventures
among the sailors who used to bully him with, 'Come, you rogue, you get
your money easily enough; spend it freely!' and he did not care if he
got rid of a guinea or two; for he was sure to have it back again after one
of the frolics&mdash;and much more. They would often clear away his whole
stock of nick-nacks. This industrious trader used to travel on foot at
the rate of from thirty to forty miles a day, and his expenses from London
to Como were but three guineas, though it cost him one third of that sum
to get to Calais. He said he liked England because the people were <em>honest</em>,
and told us some stories illustrative of English honesty and Italian over-reaching
in bargains. This amusing and, I must say, interesting companion,
turned from us by a side-path before we reached Menaggio, saying he
would meet us again, as our road would lead us near his cottage on the
heights, and he should see us from the fields. He had another dwelling on
his estate beside Cadenabbia, where the land produced excellent wine. The
produce of his farm on the <em>hills</em> was chiefly hay, which they were then
gathering in."</p>

<p>The <cite>Swiss Goatherd</cite> was a boy met by the travellers at Brunnen. Mrs.
Wordsworth thus wrote of him in her Journal:&mdash;"20th Aug.&mdash;... Mountains
rising through vapour into the sky in front, and looking back, the
two Mythen towering in great majesty. The Peasants, inhabitants of
these paradisaical retreats, very civil, and seemed gratified by our eagerness
in quest of the interests they live among. Young men, seated in one of
these spacious sheds, making merry after having ended their diversions.
The target seen everywhere. In one of the sheds as we ascended, found
four goats chewing the cud, a little boy attending, all on the bench. He
looked so pensive that we became much interested about him, but D. could
not make him understand a single word. William gave him &frac12; a &mdash;&mdash;; for
which unexpected and unsolicited gift the boy thanked him 'a hundred
thousand times.' I afterwards gave him a second piece, and the same
expression of thanks was repeated. The longer we looked at the subdued
countenance of this little Boy, the more we felt for his solitary condition.
Here, with those four mute companions, he had passed his day. The
beauty of the scenery he was among was nothing to him; and no doubt he
knew of and had heard the sound of the merriment in the vales below.
When we repassed the shed, it was empty." (Journal, vol. ii.)</p>

<p>In Dorothy Wordsworth's briefer record of the same incident, the following
occurs:&mdash;"In one of these [sheds] we found four goats (how bright in the
cool shade) beside their keeper, then sitting on the bench, an elegant-featured
Boy&mdash;dark like an Italian, ragged, silent, pensive, and timid. We
gave him a few rapps, still he was silent; then a few more, and he pronounced
in German four words intelligible to English ears, 'a hundred
thousand thanks'; but his pale cheek wanted the ready smile of the beggar's.
It seemed as if none of his pleasures were social, except what he might
have with his dumb companions." (Journal, vol. ii.)</p>

</div>

<p>This picture of the Last Supper has not only been grievously
injured by time, but the greatest part of it, if not the whole, is
said to have been retouched, or painted over again. These
niceties may be left to connoisseurs,&mdash;I speak of it as I felt.
The copy exhibited in London some years ago, and the engraving
by Merghen, are both admirable; but in the original is a
power which neither of those works has attained, or even
approached.&mdash;W. W. 1837.</p>

<p>"Sunday, Sept. 3. Milan.&mdash;... Thence we went again
to the Cathedral, and to I know not how many different
churches: St. Ambrose, very old and interesting, fine frescoes.
St. Maria della Grazia, where, in the Refectory, is the exquisite
picture of Leonardo da Vinci; but how grievous that it should
have been so injured by the brutality of the French soldiers; yet,
in its state of decay, what a Treasure! and how little everything
that we have seen of Pictures is to be compared to the truth,
the chasteness, and the composure that you see, and not only
see, but <em>feel</em>, when seated before that sublime work of human
art. The countenance of our Saviour sinks into your soul.
Happily this is uninjured, as are also the heads of several of the
Apostles, but some are quite extinguished." (From Mrs. Wordsworth's
Journal.)</p>

<p>"Sunday, 2nd September. Milan.&mdash;Went also to the convent
of Maria della Grazia to view that most famous picture of
the Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci, painted on the wall at
one end of the refectory, a very large hall, hung along the sides
with smaller pictures, and, at the other end, that painting of
the crucifixion of which we had seen a copy at Lugano. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
Refectory was used, in the days of Buonaparte, as a military
store-house, and the mark of a musket ball, fired in wantonness
by a French Soldier, is to be seen in one part of the painting
of Leonardo da Vinci. Fortunately the ball hit where the
injury was as small as it could have been; and it is only
marvellous that this fine work was not wholly defaced during
those times of military misrule and utter disregard of all sacred
things.<a name="FNanchor_II_779" id="FNanchor_II_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_II_779" class="fnanchor">[II]</a> Little conversant in pictures, I cannot take upon me
to describe this, which impressed my feelings and imagination
more than any picture I ever saw, though some of the figures
are so injured by damp that they are only just traceable. The
most important are, however, happily the least injured; and
that of our Saviour has only suffered from a general fading in
the colours, yet, alas! the fading and vanishing must go on
year after year till, at length, the whole group must pass away.
Through the cloisters of the monastery, which are shattered and
defaced, pictures are found in all parts, and there are some
curious monuments." (From Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal,
vol. ii.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Of Figures human and Divine.</em></p>

<p>The Statues ranged round the Spire and along the roof of the
Cathedral of Milan, have been found fault with by Persons
whose exclusive taste is unfortunate for themselves. It is true
that the same expense and labour judiciously directed to
purposes more strictly architectural, might have much heightened
the general effect of the building; for, seen from the ground,
the Statues appear diminutive. But the <em>coup-d'&oelig;il</em>, from the
best point of view, which is half way up the Spire, must strike
an unprejudiced Person with admiration; and surely the selection
and arrangement of the Figures is exquisitely fitted to
support the religion of the Country in the imaginations and feelings
of the Spectator. It was with great pleasure that I saw,
during the two ascents which we made, several Children, of
different ages, tripping up and down the slender spire, and
pausing to look around them, with feelings much more animated
than could have been derived from these, or the finest works of
art, if placed within easy reach.&mdash;Remember also that you
have the Alps on one side, and on the other the Apennines,
with the Plain of Lombardy between!&mdash;W. W. 1822.</p>

<p class="center"><em>The starry zone of sovereign height.</em></p>

<p>Above the highest circle of figures is a zone of metallic stars.&mdash;W. W.
1837.</p>

<p>"Thursday, Sept. 7. Cadenabbia.&mdash;... Nothing could
be more lovely than the milder scenes this morning: the little
lake Piano: the sunny glades, enlivened by groups of Peasants,
gathering in their various harvests, or seated under the shade
of some tree taking refreshment, their simple breakfast, a piece
of bread and a little fruit; then, the shadows of these trees
upon green emerald lawns, between the little lake and that of
Lugano, lay more softly than ever shadows rested before, cradled
under those stupendous perpendicular barriers. Took boat at
Porlezza. Eclipse of the Sun: could bear to look at the orb
shorn of his beams, with the naked eye: the effect produced
upon the scenery very fine, such a sombre greenness, like the
effect of bright moonlight: only under a bright moon that very
green colour generally diffused (as if you had on a pair of green
spectacles) cannot be. On the right bank of the lake the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
woods were of a rich golden green, gloomy on the left shore,
and looking back among the towering rocks, and black coves,
the region was very solemn. The water, unillumined by sunshine,
was of what I should call a <em>sad</em> green: the air cooler,
indeed a <em>coolish</em> air gently agitated the lake, while the eclipse
lasted. We congratulated ourselves in being undesignedly, and
indeed unexpectedly, in so grand a situation to witness this
phenomenon." (Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.)</p>

<p>As reference is made in the poem to "Milan's loftiest spire,"
and its "Figures human and divine," the following extracts
from the two Journals may be given in illustration:&mdash;"Sept. 2.
Milan."&mdash;"The cathedral we have thoroughly seen this morning.
It is a grand and imposing Edifice&mdash;we have been
delighted both with the building, and with the material
<em>especially</em>, all marble of the finest kind. 3000 statues of
beautiful polished white marble are stationed upon this elegant
Pile. We were upon the very top; the pinnacle so light, yet
notwithstanding the height, and its slender appearance, feeling
yourself perfectly secure.... The view of the Cathedral
itself from this station is extraordinary; the pure graceful
figures, streaming far before you, have a most interesting and
curious effect; and, from the lower roofs also, you have many
fine combinations." (Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.)</p>

<p>"Saturday, 1st September. Milan.&mdash;Our object this morning
was to ascend to the roof, where I remained alone, not
venturing to follow the rest of the party to the top of the giddy,
central spire, which is ascended by a narrow staircase twisted
round the outside. Even W. was obliged to trust to a hand
governed by a steadier head than his own. I wandered about,
with space spread around me (on the roof on which I trod),
for streets and even squares of no very diminutive Town. The
floor on which I trod was all of polished marble, intensely hot,
and as dazzling as snow; and instead of moving figures I was
surrounded by groups and stationary processions of silent
statues&mdash;saints, sages, and angels. It is impossible for me to
describe the beautiful spectacle, or to give a notion of the
delight I felt; therefore I will copy a sketch in verse composed
from my Brother's recollections of the view from the central
Spire." (From Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal, vol. ii.)</p>

<p>Henry Crabb Robinson wrote thus of these memorial
stanzas:&mdash;"Of the stanzas, I love most&mdash;loving all&mdash;'The
Eclipse of the Sun.'" (<cite>Diary</cite>, etc., vol. ii. p. 224.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

 </div>
</div>

<p>The following passage from Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal
describes</p>

<p class="p2">The Votaress by Lugano's side.</p>

<p>"Lugano, Sept. 8, Friday.&mdash;... The evening was uncommonly
fine; the road shady; bells ringing from the neighbouring
chapels, that crested many a steep rock; birds too here,
fitfully warbling from the groves; waters gushing through some
rocky cleft among the thickets; and I, at my own pace and will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
enjoyed a quiet and most refreshing walk. At every step up
and down the well-made road, meeting something new, a
different shaped mountain, or the same trees under different
combinations, a tempting path winding to a village in a
dell below, or to a nest of cottages gathered round a spire
above, a tinkling stream, or a green glade without one; and
all the way through a region of stately trees.... Here an
elegant-looking peasant Girl was putting on her gay ornaments
before she entered the Town, where also was a festival. Her
dress was so pretty I could not help noticing it, a scarlet chintz
frock with a deep figured border, a wide muslin apron, nearly
wrapping her round, also with a deep richly wrought border,
and slung by white straps over the shoulders, a gold chain
round the neck, earrings, etc.; her hair, something like Dora's,
nicely braided. Her companions were assisting to put a very
beautiful silk handkerchief upon her neck. One of them, from
the interest she seemed to take in the arrangements, might be
the mother of the Maiden; the other, a younger Sister perhaps,
who lent her aid more slackly, and would, I daresay, rather
have been in the wild fields gathering flowers to deck a Mayday
garland, or to wreath a coronal for <cite>Our Lady's</cite> head, on
this her day of Festival."</p>

<p class="p2">The intrepid Nymph, on Uri's steep, descried!</p>

<p>is thus referred to by Mrs. Wordsworth:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sunday, 20th Aug. Seewen.&mdash;... William and I
returned later than the rest, having gone further. On reaching
a knoll, before we descended into Brunnen, a pretty short-faced,
bright-eyed Girl of eighteen or nineteen met us. We enquired
the way. She answered; and we bid her good night, and
turned from her. Presently she whistled very softly, then sent
forth an uncouth sound, more as from the voice of a man than
a maiden. It was not a deep sound, but one that might be
heard in the Vale and across the Lake, and made the hills about
us ring. This was followed by a series of Swiss airs, which
she warbled without pause, one after the other, in an impassioned
manner, hurrying through as if she wished to reach the utmost
limits of her powers, before we were out of hearing; yet I cannot
but think these modulated notes meant more than we could
understand. They were probably addressed to some one at a
distance. There she stood upon the naked rock; and, as a
waterfall, the sound grew as we listened, so that I even fancied
she was following us, in sight of the villages below and around,
and her voice must have been known to those nearer dwellings,
in one of which she probably found her home."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>

<p>The "Sweet Highland Girl!" is thus described in Dorothy
Wordsworth's <cite>Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland</cite> in
1803:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sunday, Aug. 28, 1803.&mdash;After long waiting, the girls,
who had been on the look-out, informed us that the boat was
coming. I went to the waterside, and saw a cluster of people
on the opposite shore; but being yet at a distance, they looked
more like soldiers surrounding a carriage than a group of men
and women; red and green were the distinguishable colours.
We hastened to get ourselves ready as soon as we saw the party
approach, but had longer to wait than we expected, the lake
being wider than it appears to be. As they drew near we
could distinguish men in tartan plaids, women in scarlet cloaks,
and green umbrellas by the half-dozen. The landing was as
pretty a sight as ever I saw. The bay, which had been so
quiet two days before, was all in motion with small waves,
while the swollen waterfall roared in our ears. The boat came
steadily up, being pressed almost to the water's edge by the
weight of its cargo; perhaps twenty people landed, one after
another. It did not rain much, but the women held up their
umbrellas; they were dressed in all the colours of the rainbow,
and, with their scarlet cardinals, the tartan plaids of the men,
and Scotch bonnets, made a gay appearance. There was a
joyous bustle surrounding the boat, which even imparted something
of the same character to the waterfall in its tumult, and
the restless grey waves; the young men laughed and shouted, the
lasses laughed, and the elder folks seemed to be in a bustle to
be away. I remember well with what haste the mistress of the
house where we were ran up to seek after her child, and seeing
us, how anxiously and kindly she inquired how we had fared, if
we had had a good fire, had been well waited upon, etc. etc.
All this in three minutes&mdash;for the boatman had another party
to bring from the other side, and hurried us off.</p>

<p>"The hospitality we had met with at the two cottages and
Mr. Macfarlane's gave us very favourable impressions on this
our first entrance into the Highlands, and at this day the
innocent merriment of the girls, with their kindness to us, and
the beautiful figure and face of the elder, come to my mind
whenever I think of the ferry-house and waterfall of Loch
Lomond, and I never think of the two girls but the whole
image of that romantic spot is before me, a living image, as it
will be to my dying day."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal contains the following reference
to this "column":&mdash;"Sat., 9th Sept. (From Bavana to Domo
d'Ossola.)&mdash;... The fine column&mdash;Buonaparte's&mdash;seen to-day,
arrested here by the news of his overthrow, on its way to
form a part of the triumphal arch at Milan!"</p>

<p>"Sunday, 9th September. Domo d'Ossola.&mdash;At a considerable
height from the river's bed an immense column of
granite lies by the wayside, as if its course had been stopped
there by tidings of Napoleon's overthrow. It was intended by
him for his unfinished triumphal arch at Milan; and I wish
it may remain prostrate on the mountain for ages to come.
His bitterest foe could scarcely contrive a more impressive
record of disappointed vanity and ambition. The sledge upon
which it has been dragged from the quarry is rotted beneath it,
while the pillar remains as fresh and sparkling as if hewn but
yesterday. W., who came after us, said he had named it the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
'weary stone,' in memory of that immense stone in the wilds
of Peru, so called by the Indians because after 20,000 of them
had dragged it over heights and hollows, it tumbled down a
precipice, and rested immovable at the bottom, where it must
forever remain. Ere long we come to the first passage <em>through</em>
the rocks, near the River's bed, and 'Road and River'<a name="FNanchor_IO_796" id="FNanchor_IO_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_IO_796" class="fnanchor">[IO]</a> for
some time fill the bottom of the valley. We miss the bright
torrents that stream down the hills bordering the Tesino; but
here is no want of variety. We are in closer neighbourhood
with the crags; hence their shapes are continually changing,
and their appearance is the more commanding; and, wherever
an old building is seen, it is overspread with the hues of the
natural crags, and is in form of accordant irregularity. The
very road itself, however boldly it may bestride the hills or
pierce the rocks, is yet the slave of nature, its windings often
being governed as imperiously as those of the Vedra within the
chasm of the glen." (Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal.)</p>

<p>Another extract from Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal will
farther illustrate this sonnet:&mdash;</p>

<p>Milan, Sept. 20.&mdash;... "Been to see the Bibliotheca
Ambrosia.... Petrarch's Virgil delighted us more than all.
It had been clawed by Buonaparte; and he had had the audacity
to new-bind this book, and place four odious N's upon its
back. When he revisited this library, as the animated old
librarian related to us, he had this volume under his arm,
saying, 'This is mine,' and walked off with it himself. It is
well it did not remain in possession of so unworthy a master."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>Wordsworth and his friends did not visit any of the places
mentioned in the first two stanzas, but recrossed the Alps by
the Simplon route after their brief visit to the Italian Lakes.
Mrs. Wordsworth writes thus of their walk from Domo d'Ossola
to the Simplon Hospice:&mdash;"Sunday, Sept. 20.&mdash;... We
had great pleasure in discovering traces of a more difficult
ascent (in one instance, with the remains of an oratory), down
which William and Jones came thirty years ago. William
pointed out to us an ancient, high, many windowed edifice, by
the roadside, as the Hospital where they had lodged; a wild
and solemn harbour! On the opposite side of the road, a
neat little church, as clean as any English chapel, standing in
its tiny enclosure of burial ground; below, the Tusa; but its
murmur, or rather raving, could not be heard for the riotous
din of a torrent, tumbling from the stupendous mountain above,
a tumultuous sound, distinctly remembered by William, an unchangeable
object! Bonaparte's words, 'Be thou fettered,'
would have been of no avail here.... As we advance,
Pines climbing up to the skies, in some places clothing the
very pinnacles of the highest rocks. The road cut and carried
through masses of the solid rock.... Symptoms of desolation
as we advance. Mountains crumbling gradually, or
brought down by force of waters. Blasted pines standing or
torn up, and lying in a decaying state, in the torrent's bed. In
the midst of such scenes to come in view of one of those lovely
green Prairies is an enlivening sight, with its little cottage....
Watching as we did all the way snatches of the old road, we
traced it as we thought across the river and up the ascent on
the other side; and afterwards Wm. told us that there was the
very point where he and Jones had committed the same mistake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
had taken that road (as recorded in his poem) and had to
retrace their steps&mdash;and bend downwards with the stream,
under a sort of depression from the feeling that 'he had crossed
the Alps.'..."</p>

<p>They went up the Gemmi Pass from Leukerbad, passed the
Dauben See and the Schwarenbach Inn, looked into the valley
of Kandersteg, and returned to the baths of Leuk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
Mrs. Wordsworth writes:&mdash;"Wed., 13th Sept. Baths of
Leuk.&mdash;... On our right we looked down from an immense
height into Gastern Thal, a huge cleft, between the snowy
Giants, Altels and Blumlis Alp. The Kandor rises out of this
rocky recess, makes a bend at the foot of our high station, and
takes a direct course down the valley before us.... We were
very loath to return, without measuring the tempting vale
through which this river flows. Returned by the same path.
On drawing towards the little mountain Inn, the mastiff, hearing
our footsteps before we could see him, or hear his voice,
raised such a tumult in the mountains as produced the effect of
a large pack of well-toned hounds in full cry. It was a grand
sound. And this reminds me of the fine echoes called forth by
a traveller or his guide in the morning. They were before us,
as we clomb the Gemmi. The voice was a universal one; and
the prolonged and re-echoed notes could not have been more
harmonious had they proceeded from the sweetest instrument."</p>

<p>"Wednesday, 12th September. Baths of Leuk.&mdash;The
total absence of all <em>sound</em> of living <em>creature</em> was very striking:
silent moths in abundance flew about in the sunshine, and the
muddy Lake weltered below us; the only sound when we
checked our voices to listen. Hence we continued to journey
over rocky and barren ground till we suddenly looked down
into a warm, green nook, into which we must descend.
Twelve cattle were there enclosed by the crags, as in a field of
their own choosing. We passed among them, giving no disturbance,
and again came upon a tract as barren as before.
After about two leagues from the top of the Gemmi crags, the
summer Chalet, our promised resting-place, was seen facing us,
reared against the stony mountain, and overlooking a desolate
round hollow. Winding along the side of the hill (that deep
hollow beneath us to the right) a long half-mile brought us to
the platform before the door of the hut. It was a scene of
wild gaiety. Half-a-score of youthful travellers (military
students from the College of Thun) were there regaling themselves.
Mr. Robinson became sociable; and we, while the
party stood round us talking with him, had our repast spread
upon the same table where they had finished theirs. They
departed; and we saw them winding away towards the Gemmi
on the side of the precipice above the dreary hollow&mdash;a long
procession, not less interesting than the group at our approach.
But every object connected with animated nature (and human
life especially) is interesting on such a road as this; we meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
no one with a stranger's heart! I cannot forget with what
pleasure, soon after leaving the hut, we greeted two young
matrons, one with a child in her arms, the other with hers, a
lusty babe, ruddy with mountain air, asleep in its wicker cradle
on her back. Thus laden they were to descend the Gemmi
Rocks, and seemed to think it no hardship, returning us chearful
looks while we noticed the happy burthens which they
carried. Those peasant travellers out of sight, we go on over
the same rocky ground, snowy pikes and craggy eminences still
bounding the prospect. But ere long we approach the
neighbourhood of trees, and overlooking a long smooth level
covered with poor yellowish grass, saw at a distance, in the
centre of the level, a group of Travellers of a different kind&mdash;a
party of gentry, male and female, on mules. On meeting I
spoke to the two Ladies in English, by way of trying their
nation, and was pleased at being answered in the same tongue.
The lawn here was prettily embayed, like a lake, among little
eminences covered with dwarf trees, aged or blighted; thence,
onward to another open space, where was an encampment of
cattle sheds, the large plain spotted with heaps of stones at
irregular distances.... The turf was very poor, yet so
lavishly overspread with close-growing flowers it reminded us of
a Persian Carpet. The <em>silver</em> thistle, as we then named it, had
a singularly beautiful effect; a glistering star lying on the
ground, as if enwrought upon it. An avalanche had covered
the surface with stones many years ago, and many more will it
require for nature, aided by the mountaineers' industry, to
restore the soil to its former fertility. On approaching the
destined termination of our descent, we were led among
thickets of Alpine Shrubs, a rich covering of berry-bearing
plants over-spreading the ground. We followed the ridge of
this wildly beautiful tract, and it brought us to the brink of a
precipice. On our right, when we looked into the savage
valley of Gastron&mdash;upwards toward its head, and downwards to
the point where the Gastron joins the Kandor, their united
streams thence continuing a tumultuous course to the Lake of
Thun. The head of the <em>Kandor Thal</em> was concealed from us,
to our left, by the ridge of the hill on which we stood. By
going about a mile further along the ridge to the brow of its
northern extremity, we might have seen the junction of the two
rivers, but were fearful of being overtaken by darkness in
descending the Gemmi, and were, indeed, satisfied with the
prospect already gained. The river Gastron winds in tumult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
over a stony channel, through the apparently level area of a
grassless Vale, buried beneath stupendous mountains&mdash;not a
house or hut to be seen. A roaring sound ascended to us on
the eminence so high above the Vale. How <em>awful</em> the tumult
when the River carries along with it the spring tide of melted
snow! We had long viewed in our journey a snow-covered
pike, in stateliness and height surpassing all the other
eminences. The whole mass of the mountain now appeared
before us, on the same side of the Gastron vale on which we
were. It seemed very near to us, and as if a part of its base
rose from that vale. We could hardly believe our Guide when
he told us that pike was one of the summits of the Jungfrau,
took out maps and books, and found it could be no other
mountain. I never before had a conception of the space
covered by the bases of these enormous piles. After lingering
as long as time would allow, we began to remeasure our steps,
thankful for the privilege of again feeling ourselves in the
neighbourhood of the Jungfrau, and of looking upon those
heights that border the Lake of Thun, at the feet of which we
had first entered among the inner windings of Switzerland.
Our journey back to the Chalet was not less pleasant than in
the earlier part of the day. The Guide, hurrying on before us,
roused the large house-dog to give us a welcoming bark, which
echoed round the mountains like the tunable voices of a full
pack of hounds&mdash;a heart-stirring concert in that silent place
where no waters were heard at that time&mdash;no tinkling of cattle-bells;
indeed, the barren soil offers small temptation for
wandering cattle to linger there. In a few weeks our rugged
path would be closed up with snow, the hut untenanted for the
winter, and not a living creature left to rouse the echoes&mdash;echoes
which our Bard would not suffer to die with us."

<p class="center"><i>Still, with those white-robed Shapes&mdash;a living Stream,<br />
The glacier Pillars join in solemn guise.</i></p>

<p>This Procession is a part of the sacramental service performed
once a month. In the valley of Engelberg we had the good
fortune to be present at the <em>Grand Festival</em> of the Virgin&mdash;but
the Procession on that day, though consisting of upwards of
1000 persons, assembled from all branches of the sequestered
valley, was much less striking (notwithstanding the sublimity
of the surrounding scenery): it wanted both the simplicity of
the other and the accompaniment of the Glacier-columns, whose
sisterly resemblance to the <em>moving</em> Figures gave it a most
beautiful and solemn peculiarity.&mdash;W. W. 1837.</p>

<p class="p3">"Sunday, Sept. 17. Chamouny.&mdash;... As we passed
one of the little clustering villages in the Vale of Chamouny,
standing at the foot of one of the five glaciers (the Argentière I
believe), its pretty white Church at that moment was encircled
by a most interesting procession&mdash;bare-headed men first
carried the symbols or banners, who were followed by a train of
females: two and two winding round the building; white
garments thrown over their heads and covering their shoulders,
like so many nuns; but in that romantic place, the situation of
the Church, and the costume so peculiar, it was quite impossible
not to connect the moving belt of white pyramids with the
snowy ones immediately above them. We were afterwards
told by a young priest, as we passed along the green meadows
of Orsina, whither he was going to do duty, and with whom
D. fell into conversation, that it was sacrament day, and that
the ceremony we had seen occurs once a month in all the
valleys, and that those pure vestments do not belong to the
Church, but to the Individuals who wear them. Our genial
companion told D. that he lived upon the Trient, in a village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
high above its banks, and where, had he been at home, he
would have been glad to have received us as his guests...."
(Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.)</p>

<p class="p3">"Sunday, 16th September. Chamouny.&mdash;There is no
carriage-road further than to Argentière. When, having
parted with our car and Guide, we were slowly pursuing our
way to the footpath, between the mountains, which was to lead
us to the <span class="smcap">Valorsine</span>, and thence, by the Tête-Noire, to
Trientz, we heard from the churchyard of Argentière, on the
opposite side of the river, a sound of voices chanting a hymn,
or prayer, and turning round, saw in the green enclosure a
lengthening Procession,&mdash;the priest in his robes, the host, and
banners uplifted, and men following two and two&mdash;and, last
of all, a great number of females, in like order; the head and
body of each covered with a white garment. The stream
continued to flow on for a long time, till all had paced slowly
round the church, the men gathering close together, to leave
unencumbered space for the women, the chanting continuing,
while the voice of the Arve joined in accordant solemnity.
The procession was grave and simple, agreeing with the simple
decorations of a village church:&mdash;the banners made no glittering
show; the Females composed a moving girdle round the
Church; their figures, from head to foot, covered with one
piece of white cloth, resembled the small pyramids of the
Glacier, which were before our eyes, and it was impossible to
look at one and the other without fancifully connecting them
together. Imagine the <em>moving</em> figures, like a stream of
pyramids, the white Church, the half-concealed Village, and
the Glacier close behind among pine-trees, a pure sun
shining over all! and remember that these objects were seen
at the base of those enormous mountains, and you may have
some faint notion of the effect produced on us by that beautiful
spectacle. It was a farewell to the Vale of Chamouny that
can scarcely be less vividly remembered twenty years hence
than when (that wondrous Vale<a name="FNanchor_JD_823" id="FNanchor_JD_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_JD_823" class="fnanchor">[JD]</a> being just out of sight) after
ascending a little way between the mountains, through a grassy
hollow, we came to a small hamlet under shade of trees in
summer foliage. A very narrow clear rivulet, beside the
cottages, was hastening with its tribute to the Arve. This
simple scene transported us instantly to our valleys of Westmoreland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
A few quiet children were near the doors, and we
discovered a young woman in the darkest coolest nook of
shade between two of the houses, seated on the ground,
intent upon her prayer-book. The rest of the inhabitants were
gone to join in the devotions at Argentière. The top of the
ascent (not a long one) being gained, we had a second cheering
companion in our downward way, another Westmoreland brook
of larger size, as clear as crystal, open to the sun, and (bustling
but not angry) it coursed by our side through a tract of craggy
pastoral ground. I do not speak of the needles of Montanvert,
behind; nor of other pikes up-rising before us. Such sights belong
not to Westmoreland, and I could fancy that I then paid them
little regard, it being for the sake of Westmoreland alone that I
like to dwell on this short passage of our journey, which brought
us in view of one of the most interesting of the valleys of the Alps.
We descended with our little stream, and saw its brief life in a
moment cut off, when it reached the <em>Berard</em>, the river of Black
Water, which is seen falling, not in <em>black</em> but <em>grey</em> cataracts
within the cove of a mountain that well deserves the former
epithet, though a bed of <em>snow</em> and glacier ice is seen among its
piky and jagged ridges. Below those bare summits, pine
forests and crags are piled together, with lawns and cottages
between.</p>

<p>"We enter at the side of the valley, crossing a wooden
bridge; then, turning our backs on the scene just described, we
bend our course downward with the River, that is hurrying away,
fresh from its glacier fountains; how different a fellow-traveller
from that little rivulet we had just parted from, which we had
seen, still bright as silver, drop into the grey stream! The
descending Vale before us beautiful, the high enclosing hills
interspersed with woods, green pasturage, and cottages. The
delight we had in journeying through the Valorsine is not to be
imagined, sunshine and shade were alike cheering; while the
very numerousness of the brown wood cottages (descried among
trees, or outspread on the steep lawns), and the people enjoying
their Sabbath leisure out of doors, seemed to make a quiet spot
more quiet." (From Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal, vol. ii.)</p>

<p class="p3">The following account of the festival of the Virgin, which
occurred during the Wordsworths' visit to Engelberg, may
further illustrate this poem:&mdash;"Knots of peasants going to and
returning from church, all in holiday trim. We had learned
the day to be a grand Festival&mdash;the Feast of the Virgin. After
breakfast, the procession streamed out of church, a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
spectacle, as they begirt that and the monastery. Men, women,
and children, Abbot, Monks, Priests, and Choristers, a thousand
persons or upwards; the women as gay as glitter and colours
could make them. Flat white hats, with ribbons and flowers,
embroidered stomachers, red girdles, and their short black
petticoats, embroidered with red ribbon, large shining pins in
their hair, and lockets suspended from their necks. The men
too, mostly, had some ornament upon their hats: the young
generally a coloured ribbon, the elders black ones, tied with a
bow: all well and <em>curiously</em> dressed; it was a festive scene, and
the most important fête in the year. Seventeen monks belong
to the convent of Engelberg, and the whole valley contains
about 1700 inhabitants," etc. (Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.)&mdash;ED.</p>

<h3>XXXII<br />
<br />
ELEGIAC STANZAS</h3>

<p>The lamented Youth whose untimely death gave occasion to
these elegiac verses, was Frederick William Goddard, from
Boston in North America. He was in his twentieth year, and
had resided for some time with a clergyman in the neighbourhood
of Geneva for the completion of his education. Accompanied
by a fellow-pupil, a native of Scotland, he had just set out on a
Swiss tour when it was his misfortune to fall in with a friend of
mine who was hastening to join our party. The travellers, after
spending a day together on the road from Berne and at Soleure,
took leave of each other at night, the young men having intended
to proceed directly to Zurich. But early in the morning my
friend found his new acquaintances, who were informed of the
object of his journey, and the friends he was in pursuit of,
equipped to accompany him. We met at Lucerne the succeeding
evening, and Mr. G. and his fellow-student became in
consequence our travelling companions for a couple of days.
We ascended the Righi together; and, after contemplating the
sunrise from that noble mountain, we separated at an hour and
on a spot well suited to the parting of those who were to meet
no more. Our party descended through the valley of our Lady
of the Snow, and our late companions, to Arth. We had hoped
to meet in a few weeks at Geneva; but on the third succeeding
day (on the 21st of August) Mr. Goddard perished, being overset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
in a boat while crossing the lake of Zurich. His companion
saved himself by swimming, and was hospitably received in the
mansion of a Swiss gentleman (M. Keller) situated on the
eastern coast of the lake. The corpse of poor Goddard was cast
ashore on the estate of the same gentleman, who generously
performed all the rites of hospitality which could be rendered to
the dead as well as to the living. He caused a handsome mural
monument to be erected in the church of Küsnacht, which
records the premature fate of the young American, and on the
shores too of the lake the traveller may read an inscription
pointing out the spot where the body was deposited by the
waves.<a name="FNanchor_559_824" id="FNanchor_559_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_824" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p>The persuasion here expressed was not groundless. The first

from this tribute to her son's memory, a fact which the author
learned, at his own residence, from her Daughter, who visited
Europe some years afterwards.&mdash;Goldau is one of the villages
desolated by the fall of part of the Mountain Rossberg.&mdash;W. W.
1837.</p>

<p>References to Young Goddard occur in Mrs. Wordsworth's
Journal, as follows:&mdash;"Lucerne, Aug. 16.&mdash;... In bounded
Henry Robinson, ... with two young men he has picked up
on the road...." "Aug. 17.&mdash;The two young Gentlemen,
Mr. R.'s companions, called upon us to walk at 7 o'clock; and
very pleasing youths we found them, one an American, the
other a Scotsman, by birth, students from Geneva, come out
on foot for a month's excursion." "Top of Righi, Sat. 19th.&mdash;Our
pleasant ingenuous companions gone. We parted immediately
after breakfast." "Lausanne, Sept. 20.&mdash;Our joy was
damped by hearing from Mr. Mulloch, of the melancholy fate
of that very interesting youth, Mr. Goddard, with whom we
parted on the top of the Righi. He, with Mr. Trotter, descended
to pursue their way to Zurich, in which lake he was
unfortunately drowned two days afterwards; we towards
Lauritz, but all in the hope of meeting again at Altorf....
Mr. G.'s mother is in America.... Seldom have I seen so
promising a youth." "Sat. 23rd. Geneva.&mdash;Met Mr. Trotter.
The loss of poor Goddard was occasioned by a sudden squall,
which upset one of the worthless boats, made of thin planks,
flat bottomed. Mr. T. being a good swimmer, and on the
side nearest the shore, reached land, when looking for his companion,
he had disappeared, had been sucked under the boat,
and was never seen from the first moment. Great humanity
was shown by the people in the neighbourhood on this melancholy
occasion. The body was found, and afterwards buried
in the churchyard at Küsnacht, a village on the east shore of
the lake of Zurich. A discourse in German was delivered by an
old Priest, after the interment, a copy of which Mr. T. showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
us; and which Mr. R. and W. were much pleased with, for
the pathetic simplicity of the expression. It was intended to
be sent to the poor mother of the deceased."</p>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and the concluding passage of the prefatory note to the edition
of 1822, suggest another passage in Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.
"Aug. 19.&mdash;Dined at Goldau. This cottage-inn is built, as
several other houses are, on the side of the road surrounded by
masses of fallen rock: chapel close by: all walked to the ruins:
sate for a long time upon an immense mass of the fallen mountain.
It is an awful and an affecting place. We were surprised
at the extent of the desolation, especially when we looked up
to the mountain whence it had proceeded. The rent, high
above us, appeared so trifling that we could not but wonder
how all those mighty blocks had ever been piled upon so narrow
a space. Huge masses of rock on every side of us. It is aptly
called "the valley of Stones." A river had thridded this once
lovely and still interesting valley; but this, with the green
meadows which it fertilized, is buried; and the lake of Lawerz
below driven into narrower compass.... Three villages, with
their inhabitants, had been completely destroyed."</p>

<p>"Wednesday, 19th September. Lausanne.&mdash;We met with
some pleasant Englishmen, from whom we heard particulars
concerning the melancholy fate of our young Friend, the
American, seen by us for the last time on the top of the Righi.
The tidings of his death had been first communicated, but a few
hours before, by Mr. Mulloch. We had the comfort of hearing
that his friend had saved himself by swimming, and had paid
the last duties to the stranger, so far from home and kindred,
who lies quietly in the churchyard of Küsnacht on the shores
of Zurich." (From Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal, vol. ii.)</p>

<p>On the 24th Nov. 1821, Dorothy Wordsworth wrote to
Henry Crabb Robinson:&mdash;"... Amongst the Poems (the
<cite>Tour on the Continent</cite>) is one to the memory of poor Goddard,
which probably never would have been written but for your
suggestion. How often do I think of that night when you first
introduced that interesting youth to us! At this moment I see
in my mind's eye the lighted Salon, you in your great-coat, and
the two slender tall figures following you!"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>On arriving at Lausanne, we heard of the fate of the Young

<h3>XXXIII<br />
<br />
SKY-PROSPECT&mdash;FROM THE PLAIN OF
FRANCE</h3>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Lo! in the burning west, the craggy nape</div>
  <div class="i0">Of a proud Ararat! and, thereupon,</div>
  <div class="i0">The Ark, her melancholy voyage done!</div>
  <div class="i0">Yon rampant cloud mimics a lion's shape;</div>
 <span class="linenum">5</span>
  <div class="i0">There, combats a huge crocodile&mdash;agape</div>
  <div class="i0">A golden spear to swallow! and that brown</div>
  <div class="i0">And massy grove, so near yon blazing town,</div>
  <div class="i0">Stirs and recedes&mdash;destruction to escape!</div>
  <div class="i0">Yet all is harmless&mdash;as the Elysian shades</div>
 <span class="linenum">10</span>
  <div class="i0">Where Spirits dwell in undisturbed repose&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Silently disappears, or quickly fades:</div>
  <div class="i0">Meek Nature's evening comment on the shows</div>
  <div class="i0">That for oblivion take their daily birth</div>
  <div class="i0">From all the fuming vanities of Earth!</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The only allusion in Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal to any noteworthy
"sky-prospect from the plain of France," occurs when
they rested at Fontainbleau. "Sept. 30.&mdash;... Seeing the
forest rise at the end of a long vista of trees, our guide said that
from that point we should have a fine view. Passed through
the old-fashioned French flower garden, with its large sheet of
water.... Surprised by the view from the hill, first towards
the palace, and the expanse beyond, and immediately opposite
this (what we so little expected to see) a rocky dell in that
sandy region; most curious, the bank before us scattered thickly
with rocks, by that dim light appearing like a large village.
Glorious crimson light in the west, all the rest of the sky a clear
cloudless blue. The evening star very large, and alone. An
impressive silence in the air, so that we heard the sounds from
the distant town distinctly."</p>

<p>"Saturday, 29th September. Fontainbleau.&mdash;In the very
heart of the Alps, I never saw a more wild and lonely spot, yet
<em>curious</em> in the extreme, and even <em>beautiful</em>. Thousands of
white bleached rocks, mostly in appearance not much larger
than sheep, lay on the steep declivities of the dell among bushes
and low trees, heather, bilberries, and other forest plants. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
effect of loneliness and desert wildness was indescribably increased
by the remembrance of the Palace we had left not an
hour before. The spot on which we stood is said to have been
frequented by Henry the IVth. when he wished to retire from
his court and attendants. A few steps more brought us in view
of fresh ranges of the forest, hills, plains, and distant lonely
dells. The sunset was brilliant&mdash;light clouds in the west, and
overhead a spotless blue dome. As we wind along the top of
the Steep, the views are still changing&mdash;the plain expands eastward,
and again appear the white buildings of Fontainbleau,
with something of romantic brightness in the <em>fading</em> light; for
we had tarried till a star or two reminded us it was time to
move away. In descending, we followed one of the long
straight tracks that intersect the forest in all directions. Bewildered
among those tracks, we were set right by a party of
wood-cutters, going home from their labour." (From Dorothy
Wordsworth's Journal, vol. ii.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>

<p>Near the Town of Boulogne, and overhanging the Beach,
are the remains of a Tower which bears the name of Caligula,
who here terminated his western Expedition, of which these
sea-shells were the boasted spoils. And, at no great distance
from these Ruins, Buonaparte, standing upon a mound of earth,
harangued his "Army of England," reminding them of the
exploits of Cæsar, and, pointing towards the white cliffs upon
which their standards <em>were to float</em>. He recommended also a
subscription to be raised among the Soldiery to erect on that
Ground, in memory of the Foundation of the "Legion of
Honour," a Column,&mdash;which was not completed at the time we
were there.&mdash;W. W. 1822.</p>

<p>"Embarked in a small vessel; wind contrary. The vessel
struck upon a sandbank. Then was driven with violence upon
a rocky road in the harbour. Tide was ebbing very fast."
(Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.)</p>

<p>"Monday, 29th October. Boulogne.&mdash;We walked to
Buonaparte's Pillar, which, on the day when he harangued his
soldiers (pointing to the shores of England whither he should
lead them to conquest), he decreed should be erected in commemoration
of the Legion of Honour then established. The
pillar is seen far and wide, <em>unfinished</em>, as the intricate casing of
a <em>scaffolding loftier than itself, shows at whatever distance</em> it is
seen. It is said the Bourbons intend to complete the work,
and give it a new name; but I think it more probable that the
scaffolding may be left to fall away, and the Pile of marble remain
strewn round, as it is, with unfinished blocks, an
undisputed Monument of the Founder's vanity and arrogance;
and <em>so</em> it may stand as long as the brick towers of Caligula have
done, a remnant of which yet appears on the cliffs. We walked
on the ground which had been covered by the army that dreamt
of conquering England, and were shown the very spot where
their Leader made his boastful speech.</p>

<p>"On the day fixed for our departure from Boulogne, the
weather being boisterous and wind contrary, the <em>Packet</em> could
not sail, and we trusted ourselves to a small vessel, with only
one effective sailor on board. Even <em>Mary</em> was daunted by the
Breakers outside the Harbour, and <em>I</em> descended into the vessel
as unwillingly as a criminal might go to execution, and hid myself
in bed. Presently our little ship moved; and before ten
minutes were gone she struck upon the sands. I felt that
something disastrous had happened; but knew not what till
poor Mary appeared in the cabin, having been thrown down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
from the top of the steps. There was again a frightful beating
and grating of the bottom of the vessel, water rushing in very
fast. A young man, an Italian, who had risen from a bed
beside mine, as pale as ashes, groaned in agony, kneeling at
his prayers. My condition was not much better than his; but
I was more quiet. Never shall I forget the kindness of a little
Irish woman who, though she herself, as she afterwards said,
was much frightened, assured me even chearfully that there was
no danger. I cannot say that her words, as assurances of
safety, had much effect upon me; but the example of her
courage made me become more collected; and I felt her human
kindness even at the moment when I believed that we might be
all going to the bottom of the sea together; and the agonizing
thoughts of the distress at home were rushing on my mind."

<p>This is a most grateful sight for an Englishman returning to
his native land. Every where one misses, in the cultivated
scenery abroad, the animating and soothing accompaniment of
animals ranging and selecting their own food at will.&mdash;W. W.
1822.</p>

<p>"Dover, Wed., 8th Nov.&mdash;At 11 o'clock we took coach
and thoroughly enjoyed our journey between the green pastures
of Kent, besprinkled with groups of trees, and bounded by
hedgerows. The scattered cattle quietly selecting their own
food was a cheering, and a home-feeling sight." (Mrs. Wordsworth's
Journal.)</p>

<p>"It was, I think, 10 o'clock when we left Dover. The
day was pleasant, and every English sight delightful, the fields
sprinkled with cattle, the hedgerows, the snug small cottages,
the pretty country-houses. Many a time we said to each other,
'What a pleasant country this must appear to the eyes of a
Frenchman!'" (From Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal, vol.

<p>Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal of this Continental Tour contains
the modest entry, made at "Paris, Monday, Oct. 2nd.&mdash;... I
shall here close these very imperfect notices, commenced at D.'s
request; and with a notion, on my part, that they might be
useful when she wrote her Journal: but soon finding that, with
such a view, mine was a superfluous labour, I should not have
had the resolution to go on, except at Wm.'s desire, and from
the feeling that my Daughter, and perhaps her brothers, might
one day find pleasure, should they ever have the good fortune
to trace our steps, in recognising objects their Mother had seen."</p>

<p>Sarnen, one of the two Capitals of the Canton of Underwalden; the
spot here alluded to is close to the town, and is called the Landenberg, from
the Tyrant of that name, whose chateau formerly stood there. On the 1st
of Jan. 1308, the great day which the confederated Heroes had chosen for
the deliverance of their Country, all the Castles of the Governors were taken
by force or stratagem; and the Tyrants themselves conducted, with their
Creatures, to the frontiers, after having witnessed the destruction of their
Strong-holds. From that time the Landenberg has been the place where
the Legislators of this division of the Canton assemble. The site, which is well
described by Ebel, is one of the most beautiful in Switzerland.&mdash;W. W. 1822.</p>

<p>"Sarnen, Aug. 14.&mdash;... The buildings we have been to visit are
Government Houses. There all business relating to the canton is transacted.
The meetings are sometimes held in the open air: a green area is set apart,
with steps around for this purpose. Marks to shoot at, bowls, etc., are here
ready, for the days of festival," etc. (Mrs. Wordsworth's Journal.)</p></div>

Scripture History on the Cathedral-bridge, amount, according to my notes,
to 240. Subjects from the Old Testament face the Passenger as he goes
towards the Cathedral, and those from the New as he returns. The pictures
on these Bridges, as well as those in most other parts of Switzerland, are not
to be spoken of as works of art; but they are instruments admirably
answering the purpose for which they were designed.&mdash;W. W. 1822.</p>

to Boulogne. Set off from Paris at 8 o'clock on Saturday
morning, and arrived at Boulogne at about 9 on Sunday night.</p>


<p class="p2">NOTE B</p>

<p>The following are extracts from Henry Crabb Robinson's
account of his "Swiss Tour with the Wordsworths." (See
<cite>Diary, Correspondence</cite>, etc., vol. ii. pp. 167-191.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>I left London on the 1st of August, and reached Lyons on
the 9th.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the 15th I went to Solothurn, and an acquaintance began
out of which a catastrophe sprang. In the stage between Berne
and Solothurn, which takes a circuit through an unpicturesque,
flat country, were two very interesting young men, who I soon
learned were residing with a Protestant clergyman at Geneva,
and completing their education. The elder was an American,
aged twenty-one, named Goddard. He had a sickly air, but
was intelligent, and not ill-read in English poetry. The other
was a fine handsome lad, aged sixteen, of the name of Trotter,
son of the then, or late, Secretary to the Admiralty. He was
of Scotch descent. They were both genteel and well-behaved
young men, with the grace communicated by living in good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
company. We became at once acquainted,&mdash;I being then, as
now, <em>young</em> in the facility of forming acquaintance. We spent
a very agreeable day and evening together, partly in a walk
to a hermitage in the neighbourhood, and took leave of each
other at night,&mdash;I being bound for Lucerne, they for Zürich.
But in the morning I saw, to my surprise, my young friends
with their knapsacks in their hands ready to accompany me.
Goddard said, with a very amiable modesty, "If you will
permit us, we wish to go with you. I am an admirer of
Wordsworth's poems, and I should be delighted merely to see
him. Of course I expect no more." I was gratified by this
proposal, and we had a second day of enjoyment, and this
through a very beautiful country. My expectations were not
disappointed. I had heard of the Wordsworth party from
travellers with whom we met. I found my friends at the
Cheval Blanc. From them I had a most cordial reception, and
I was in high spirits. Mrs. Wordsworth wrote in her journal:
"H. C. R. was drunk with pleasure, and made us drunk too."
My companions also were kindly received.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Wordsworth and I returned to dinner, and found my young
friends already in great favour with the ladies. After dinner
we walked through the town, which has no other remarkable
feature than the body of water flowing through it, and the
several covered wooden bridges. In the angles of the roof of
these bridges there are paintings on historical and allegorical
subjects. One series from the Bible, another from the Swiss
war against Austria, a third called the Dance of Death. The
last is improperly called, for Death does not force his partner
to an involuntary waltz, as in the famous designs which go by
Holbein's name, but appears in all the pictures an unwelcome
visitor. There are feeling and truth in many of the conceptions,
but the expression is too often ludicrous, and too often coarsely
didactic.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>August 18th.</em>&mdash;We sailed on the lake as far as Küsnacht,
the two young men being still our companions; and between
two and three we began to ascend the Righi, an indispensable
achievement in a Swiss tour. We engaged beds at the Staffel, and
went on to see the sun set, but we were not fortunate in the
weather. Once or twice there were gleams of light on some of
the lakes, but there was little charm of colouring. After an
early and comfortable supper we enjoyed the distant lightning;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
but it soon became very severe, and some of the rooms of the
hotel were flooded with rain. Our rest was disturbed by a
noisy party, who, unable to obtain beds for themselves, resolved
that no one else should enjoy his. The whole night was spent
by them in an incessant din of laughing, singing, and shouting.
We were called up between three and four <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, but had a
very imperfect view from this "dread summit of the Queen of
Mountains"&mdash;Regina montium. The most beautiful part of
the scene was that which arose from the clouds below us.
They rose in succession sometimes concealing the country, and
then opening to our view dark lakes, and gleams of very
brilliant green. They sometimes descended as if into an abyss
beneath us. We saw a few of the snow-mountains illuminated
by the first rays of the sun.</p>

<p>My journal simply says: "After breakfast our young
gentlemen left us." I afterwards wrote, "We separated at a
spot well suited to the parting of those who were to meet no
more. Our party descended through the valley of our 'Lady
of the Snow,' and our late companions went to Arth. We
hoped to meet in a few weeks at Geneva."</p>

<p>I will leave the order of time, and relate now all that
appertains to this sad history. The young men gave us their
address, and we promised to inform them when we should be
at Geneva, on our return. But on that return we found that
poor Goddard had perished in the lake of Zürich, on the third
day after our leave-taking on the Righi.</p>

<p>I heard the story from Trotter on the 23rd of September.
They had put themselves in a crazy boat; and a storm arising,
the boat overset. It righted itself, but to no purpose. Trotter
swam to the shore, but Goddard was not seen again. Trotter
was most hospitably received by a Mr. Keller, near whose house
the catastrophe took place. The body was cast ashore next
day, and afterwards interred in the neighbouring churchyard of
Küsnacht. An inscription was placed near the spot where the
body was found, and a mural monument erected in the church.
At the funeral a pathetic address was delivered by the
Protestant clergyman, which I read in the Zürich paper. We
were all deeply impressed by the event. Wordsworth, I knew,
was not fond of drawing the subjects of his poems from
occurrences in themselves interesting, and therefore, though I
urged him to write on this tragic incident, I little expected he
would. There is, however, a beautiful elegiac poem by him on
this subject. [To the later editions there is prefixed a prose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
introduction. This I wrote. Mr. Wordsworth wrote to me
for information, and I drew up the account in the first person.]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To go back to the 19th of August, after parting from our
young companions we proceeded down the valley in which is
the chapel dedicated to our Lady of the Snow, the subject of
Wordsworth's nineteenth Poem. The preceding eighteen have
to do with objects which had been seen before I joined the
party. The elegiac stanzas are placed near the end of the
collection, I know not for what reason. The stanzas on the
chapel express poetically the thoughts which a prosaic mind
like mine might receive from the numerous votive offerings
hung on the walls. There are pictures representing accidents,&mdash;such
as drowning, falling from a horse, and the Mother and
the Child are in the clouds,&mdash;it being understood that the escape
proceeded from her aid. Some crutches with painted inscriptions
bear witness to the miracles wrought on the lame.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We passed the same day through Goldau, a desolate spot,
once a populous village, overwhelmed by the slip from the
Rossberg.</p>

<p>On the 20th at Schwytz, which Wordsworth calls the
"heart" of Switzerland, as Berne is the "head." Passing
through Brunnen, we reached Altorf on the 21st, the spot which
suggested Wordsworth's twentieth effusion. My prose remark
on the people shows the sad difference between observation
and fancy. I wrote: "These patriotic recollections are delightful
when genuine, but the physiognomy of the people does not
speak in favour of their ancestors. The natives of the district
have a feeble and melancholy character. The women are
afflicted by goître. The children beg, as in other Catholic
cantons. The little children, with cross-bows in their hands,
sing unintelligible songs. Probably Wilhelm Tell serves, like
Henri Quatre, as a name to beg by."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We next crossed the St. Gotthard. Wordsworth thinks this
pass more beautiful than the more celebrated [a blank here].
We slept successively at Amsteg on the 22nd, Hospenthal on
the 23rd, and Airolo on the 24th. On the way we were overtaken
by a pedestrian, a young Swiss, who had studied at
Heidelberg, and was going to Rome. He had his flute, and
played the Ranz des Vaches. Wordsworth begged me to ask
him to do this, which I did on condition that he wrote a sonnet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
on it. It is <span class="smcap">XXII.</span> of the collection. The young man was
intelligent, and expressed pleasure in our company. We were
sorry when he took French leave. We were English, and I
have no doubt he feared the expense of having such costly companions.
He gave a sad account of the German Universities,
and said that Sand, the murderer of Kotzebue, had many
apologists among the students.</p>

<p>We then proceeded on our half-walk and half-drive, and
slept on the 25th at Bellinzona, the first decidedly Italian town.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the 27th we had a row to Luino, on the Lago Maggiore,
a walk to Ponte Tresa, and then a row to Lugano, where we
went to an excellent hotel, kept by a man of the name of Rossi.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the 28th we took an early walk up the mountain San
Salvador, which produced No. <span class="smcap">XXIV.</span> of Wordsworth's Memorial
Poems. Though the weather was by no means favourable,
we enjoyed a much finer view than from the Righi. The
mountains in the neighbourhood are beautiful, but the charm
of the prospect lies in a glimpse of distant mountains. We saw
a most elegant pyramid, literally in the sky, partly black, and
partly shining like silver. It was the Simplon, Mont Blanc
and Monte Rosa were seen in parts. Clouds concealed the
bases, and too soon also the summits. This splendid vision
lasted but a few minutes. The plains of Piedmont were hardly
visible, owing to the black clouds which covered this part of
the horizon. We could, however, see in the midst of a dark
surface a narrow ribbon of white, which we were told was the
Po. We were told the direction in which Milan lay, but could
not see the cathedral.</p>

<p>The same day we went on to Menaggio, on the Lake Como.
This, in Wordsworth's estimation, is the most beautiful of the
lakes. On the 29th and 30th we slept at Cadenabbia.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I wrote in my journal: "This day has been spent on the
lake, and so much exquisite pleasure I never had on water.
The tour, or rather excursion, we have been making surpasses
in scenery all that I have ever made; and Wordsworth asserts
the same. I write now from an inn where we have been served
with all the promptitude of an English hotel, and with a neatness
equal to that of Holland. But the pleasure can hardly
be recorded. It consists in the contemplation of scenes absolutely
indescribable by words, and in sensations for which no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
words have been even invented. We were lucky in meeting
two honest fellows of watermen, who have been attentive and
not extortionate. I will not enumerate the points of view and
villas we visited. We saw nothing the guide-books do not
speak of."</p>

<p>On the 31st we slept at Como, and next day went to Milan.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the Ambrosian Library we inspected the famous copy of
Virgil which belonged to Petrarch. It has in the poet's own
handwriting a note, stating when and where he first saw Laura.
Wordsworth was deeply interested in this entry, and would
certainly have requested a copy, if he had not been satisfied
that he should find it in print. The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">custos</i> told us that when
Buonaparte came here first, and the book was shown him, he
seized it, exclaiming, "This is mine." He had it bound, and
his own <em>N.</em> marked on it. It came back when the other
plunder was restored. Another curiosity was a large book by
Leonardo da Vinci, full of mechanical studies. Wordsworth
was much struck with the fact that a man who had produced
works of so great beauty and sublimity, had prepared himself
by intense and laborious study of scientific and mathematical
details. It was not till late that he ventured on beauty as exhibited
in the human form.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the great attraction of this neighbourhood is the celebrated
picture of Leonardo da Vinci in the refectory of the
Convent of Maria della Grazia. After sustaining every injury
from Italian monks, French soldiers, wet, and the appropriation
of the building to secular purposes, this picture is now protected
by the public sense of its excellence from further injury. And
more remains of the original than from Goethe's dissertation I
expected to see. The face of our Saviour appears to have
suffered less than any other part. And the countenance has in
it exquisite feeling; it is all sweetness and dignity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some of the Apostles have a somewhat caricature expression,
which has been far better preserved in the several copies existing,
as well as in the engraving of Raphael Morgen. There is
a sort of mawkish sentimentality in the copies of St. John,
which always offended me. There is less of it in the original.
That and St. Andrew are the best preserved next to the face of Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 5th of September the Wordsworths went back to
the lake of Como, in order to gratify Miss Wordsworth, who
wished to see every spot which her brother saw in his first
journey,&mdash;a journey made when he was young.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We rejoined the Wordsworths at Baveno on the 8th. Then
we crossed the Simplon, resting successively on the 9th at
Domo d'Ossola, 10th Simplon, 11th Turtman, and the 12th
and 13th at the baths of Leuk. From this place we walked
up the Gemmi, by far the most wonderful of all the passes of
Switzerland I had ever, or have now ever, crossed. The most
striking part is a mountain wall 1600 feet in perpendicular
height, and having up it a zigzag path broad enough to enable
a horse to ascend. The road is hardly visible from below. A
parapet in the more dangerous parts renders it safe. Here my
journal mentions our seeing men employed in picking up bees in
a torpid state from the cold. The bees had swarmed four days
before. It does not mention what I well recollect, and
Wordsworth has made the subject of a sonnet, the continued
barking of a dog <em>irritated by the echo of his own voice</em>. In
human life this is perpetually occurring. It is said that a dog
has been known to contract an illness by the continued labour of
barking at his own echo. In the present instance the barking
lasted while we were on the spot.</p>

<p>I say nothing of Chamouni, where we slept two nights, the
15th and 16th; nor of the roads to it, but that the Tête Noire,
by which we returned, is still more interesting than the Col de
Balme, by which we went. Again at Martigny on the 17th.
I should not have omitted to mention that, to add to the
sadness produced by the Valais, Wordsworth remarked that
there the Alps themselves were in a state of decay&mdash;crumbling
to pieces. His is the line:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">The human soul craves something that endures.</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>On the 18th we were at Villeneuve, and on the 19th and
20th at Lausanne.</p>

<p>At Paris I renewed my old acquaintances, and saw the old
sights.</p>

<p>On the 8th I left the Wordsworths, who were intending to
prolong their stay. On the 9th I slept at Amiens; on the
10th was on the road; on the 11th reached Dover; and on
the 12th of October slept in my own chambers.</p>

<p>"And so," my journal says, "I concluded my tour in excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
health and spirits, having travelled farther, and seen a
greater number and a greater variety of sublime and beautiful
objects, and in company better calculated to make me feel the
worth of these objects, than any it has been my good fortune to
enjoy."</p>
